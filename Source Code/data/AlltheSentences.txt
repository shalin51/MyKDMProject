President Barack ObamaBarack Obama is the 44th President of the United States. His story is the American story -- values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.Barack H. Obama is the 44th President of the United States.His story is the American story � values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank.After working his way through college with the help of scholarships and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of local steel plants.He went on to attend law school, where he became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community.President Obama's years of public service are based around his unwavering belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years, cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending online.He was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009. He and his wife, Michelle, are the proud parents of two daughters, Malia and Sasha.Obama and His Pot-Smoking 'Choom Gang'Unlike Bill Clinton, Barack Obama never tried to say he didn't inhale.In his 1995 memoir "Dreams of My Father," Obama writes about smoking pot almost like Dr. Seuss wrote about eating green eggs and ham. As a high school kid, Obama wrote, he would smoke "in a white classmate's sparkling new van," he would smoke "in the dorm room of some brother" and he would smoke "on the beach with a couple of Hawaiian kids."He would smoke it here and there. He would smoke it anywhere.Now a soon-to-be published biography by David Maraniss entitled "Barack Obama: The Story" gives more detail on Obama's pot-smoking days, complete with testimonials from young Barry Obama's high school buddies, a group that went by the name "the Choom Gang." Choom was slang for smoking marijuana.Maraniss portrays the teenage Obama as not just a pot smoker, but a pot-smoking innovator."As a member of the Choom Gang," Maraniss writes, "Barry Obama was known for starting a few pot-smoking trends."The first Obama-inspired trend: "Total Absorption" or "TA"."TA was the opposite of Bill Clinton's claim that as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford he smoked dope but never inhaled," explains Maraniss. Here's how it worked: If you exhaled prematurely when you were with the Choom Gang, "you were assessed a penalty and your turn was skipped the next time the joint came around."As one of Obama's old high school buddies tells Maraniss: "Wasting good bud smoke was not tolerated."Another Obama innovation: "Roof Hits.""When they were chooming in a car all the windows had to be rolled up so no smoke blew out and went to waste; when the pot was gone, they tilted their heads back and sucked in the last bit of smoke from the ceiling."Maraniss also says Obama was known for his "Interceptions": "When a joint was making the rounds, he often elbowed his way in, out of turn, shouted 'Intercepted!,' and took an extra hit."Although Obama himself wrote that he and his pot smoking buddies were a "club of disaffection," Maraniss says that's not really true."In fact, most members of the Choom Gang were decent students and athletes who went on to successful and productive lawyers, writers and businessmen," Maraniss writes. One notable exception was Ray, the group's pot dealer who, known for his ability "to score quality bud," would years later be killed by a scorned gay lover armed with a ball-peen hammer.Obama himself managed to be a pretty good student despite all the pot smoking and unconventional study habits."He told his Choom Gang mates that the trick was if you put the textbook under your pillow the night before you would perform better on an exam," Maraniss writes. No way, dude!Back to the pot smoking.Hawaii of the early 1970s was something of a pot-smoking Mecca."It was sold and smoked right there in front of your nose; Maui Wowie, Kauai Electric, Puna Bud, Kona Gold, and other local variations of pakalolo were readily available," writes Maraniss.Obama's pal Mark Bendix had a Volkswagen microbus known as "the Choomwagon." They would often drive up Honolulu's Mount Tantalus where they parked "turned up their stereos playing Aerosmith, Blue Oyster Cult and Stevie Wonder, lit up some 'sweet-sticky Hawaiian buds' and washed it down with 'green bottled beer' (the Choom Gang preferred Heineken, Becks, and St. Pauli Girl). No shouting, no violence, no fights; they even cleaned up their beer bottles."Of course, smoking, drinking and driving on mountain roads could also be a little dangerous. Especially the night they tried drag racing.The race to the top of Mount Tantalus pitted the "Choomwagon" against another friend's Toyota. Obama was in the Toyota. The Choomwagon made it to the top first. When the other car didn't show up, those in the Choomwagon drove back down to find them. Here's how Maraniss describes what happened next:"On the way down, they saw a figure who appeared to be staggering up the road. It was Barry Obama. What was going on? As they drew closer, they noticed that he was laughing so hard he could barely stand up."His friend had rolled the car. Fortunately, nobody was hurt. And, amazingly, they avoided trouble by leaving the driver alone to deal with the police by claiming it was just an unfortunate "mishap."Maraniss concludes his chapter on Obama's high school years by looking at a note Obama had written in his high school yearbook in a section reserved for students to give a line or two giving thanks to those who helped along the way.Obama had written this: "Thanks Tut [his grandmother], Gramps, Choom Gang, and Ray for all the good times."Maraniss notes: "Ray was the older guy who hung around the Choom Gang, selling them pot. A hippie drug dealer made his acknowledgements; his mother did not."The White House told ABC News that it has no comment.Though Obama Had to Leave to Find Himself, It Is Hawaii That Made His Rise PossibleOn weekday mornings as a teenager, Barry Obama left his grandparents' apartment on the 10th floor of the 12-story high-rise at 1617 S. Beretania, a mile and a half above Waikiki Beach, and walked up Punahou Street in the shadows of capacious banyan trees and date palms. Before crossing the overpass above the H1 freeway, where traffic zoomed east to body-surfing beaches or west to the airport and Pearl Harbor, he passed Kapiolani Medical Center, walking below the hospital room where he was born on Aug. 4, 1961. Two blocks farther along, at the intersection with Wilder, he could look left toward the small apartment on Poki where he had spent a few years with his little sister, Maya, and his mother, Ann, back when she was getting her master's degree at the University of Hawaii before she left again for Indonesia. Soon enough he was at the lower edge of Punahou School, the gracefully sloping private campus where he studied some and played basketball more.An adolescent life told in five Honolulu blocks, confined and compact, but far, far away. Apart from other unprecedented aspects of his rise, it is a geographical truth that no politician in American history has traveled farther than Barack Obama to be within reach of the White House. He was born and spent most of his formative years on Oahu, in distance the most removed population center on the planet, about 2,390 miles from California, farther from a major landmass than anywhere but Easter Island. In the westward impulse of American settlement, his birthplace was the last frontier, an outpost with its own time zone, the 50th of the United States, admitted to the union only two years before Obama came along.Those who come from islands are inevitably shaped by the experience. For Obama, the experience was all contradiction and contrast.As the son of a white woman and a black man, he grew up as a multiracial kid, a "hapa," "half-and-half" in the local lexicon, in one of the most multiracial places in the world, with no majority group. There were native Hawaiians, Japanese, Filipinos, Samoans, Okinawans, Chinese and Portuguese, along with Anglos, commonly known as haole (pronounced how-lay), and a smaller population of blacks, traditionally centered at the U.S. military installations. But diversity does not automatically translate to social comfort: Hawaii has its own difficult history of racial and cultural stratification, and young Obama struggled to find his place even in that many-hued milieu.He had to leave the island to find himself as a black man, eventually rooting in Chicago, the antipode of remote Honolulu, deep in the fold of the mainland, and there setting out on the path that led toward politics. Yet life circles back in strange ways, and in essence it is the promise of the place he left behind -- the notion if not the reality of Hawaii, what some call the spirit of aloha, the transracial if not post-racial message -- that has made his rise possible. Hawaii and Chicago are the two main threads weaving through the cloth of Barack Obama's life. Each involves more than geography.Hawaii is about the forces that shaped him, and Chicago is about how he reshaped himself. Chicago is about the critical choices he made as an adult: how he learned to survive in the rough-and-tumble of law and politics, how he figured out the secrets of power in a world defined by it, and how he resolved his inner conflicts and refined the subtle, coolly ambitious persona now on view in the presidential election. Hawaii comes first. It is what lies beneath, what makes Chicago possible and understandable.Hawaii involves the struggles of a teenage hapa at Punahou School who wanted nothing more than to be a professional basketball player. It is about his extraordinary mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, deeply loving if frequently absent. While politicians burnish their histories by laying claim to early years of community work and lives of public service, she was the real deal, devoting her career, unsung and underpaid, to helping poor women make their way in the modern world.It is about his mysterious father, Barack Hussein Obama, an imperious if alluring voice gone distant and then missing. It is about his grandparents, Madelyn and Stan Dunham, Toot and Gramps, the white couple with whom he lived for most of his teenage years, she practical and determined, he impulsive, hokey, well-intentioned and, by his grandson's account, burdened with the desperate lost hopes of a Willy Loman-style salesman. It is about their family's incessant migration away from the heartland, from the Great Plains to the West Coast to Hawaii.And that was not far enough for their daughter, who followed the Pacific farther to Indonesia and traveled the world until, at the too-early age of 52, she made her way back to Honolulu, taking an apartment next to her parents' in the high-rise on the corner of Beretania and Punahou, to die there of cancer. It was the same year, 1995, that her son made his debut on the national stage with a book about himself that searched for the missing, the void -- his dad, Kenya, Africa -- and paid less attention to the people and things that had shaped his life, especially his mother.The simple fact is that he would not exist as a human being, let alone as a politician, without his mother's sensibility, naive or adventurous or both. Of all the relationships in Obama's life, none has been deeper, more complex or more important. They lived under the same roof for only perhaps 12 years and were frequently apart during his adolescence, but her lessons and judgments were always with him. In some sense, because they were just 18 years apart, they grew up together, each following a singular path toward maturity.Like many presidential aspirants before him, and perhaps most like Bill Clinton, Obama grew up surrounded by strong women, the male figures either weak or absent. Once, during the heat of the primary race between Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, a claim came from Bill Clinton that he "understood" Obama. As different as their backgrounds and families were, it was no doubt this strong-female, weak-male similarity that he had in mind.Twin sisters, Obama on parallel paths for yearsRetracing the steps of history, Eleanor Nordyke now realizes that she was in labor with twin daughters while Barack Obama, now the president-elect, was being born at what is now Kapi-'olani Medical Center for Women & Children.The twins, Susan "Nunu" Bell and Gretchen "Nini" Worthington, were not only born in the same hospital hours after the future president, but also ended up in the same classes with Obama at Noelani Elementary School and later at Punahou School from the seventh grade to graduation in 1979."I think it was remarkable that they just so happened to be born within 24 hours of each other and grew up knowing each other," Nordyke said.She did not know Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, while they were in labor together on Aug. 4, 1961, at the old Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital.But Nordyke was a population research fellow at the East-West Center while Dunham was there. And Nordyke later met Madelyn Dunham � Ann Dunham's mother and Obama's grandmother � during a cruise to Tahiti in 2002."She was placed at our table on the ship," Nordyke said. "She sat with us on that ship for three weeks. She told us that her daughter had passed away and that she had raised her grandson, and he was a social worker in Chicago."When Obama was making his successful presidential run, Nordyke realized that her daughters were born within hours of him at the same hospital.The Hawai'i certificate of live birth that Obama displays on his Web site shows he was born at 7:24 p.m. on Aug. 4.Nordyke was well into labor by then with girls who were three weeks premature. By 2 p.m. the following day, Susan was born at 5 pounds, 12 ounces, and Gretchen weighed in at 6 pounds, 4 ounces.As toddlers, the girls called each other "Nunu" and "Nini" "and the other children picked it up, and we held onto it all this time," Nordyke said.With the names Nordyke and Obama, the twins were often pictured near Obama in their class yearbooks, their mother said.The daughters now live on the Mainland, and neither returned repeated telephone messages seeking comment.But one or both may return to Honolulu in June when their class celebrates its 30th reunion, Nordyke said.The Story of Barack Obama's MotherBarack Obama's greatest influence was a woman most know nothing about. How her uncommon life shaped his worldviewEach of us lives a life of contradictory truths. We are not one thing or another. Barack Obama's mother was at least a dozen things. S. Ann Soetoro was a teen mother who later got a Ph.D. in anthropology; a white woman from the Midwest who was more comfortable in Indonesia; a natural-born mother obsessed with her work; a romantic pragmatist, if such a thing is possible."When I think about my mother," Obama told me recently, "I think that there was a certain combination of being very grounded in who she was, what she believed in. But...Criminals IN Government: Cyprus President�s Family Transferred Tens Of Millions To London Days Before Deposit Haircuts By Zero HedgeA day after former Cypriot President Vassilou was found to be among many elite Cypriot (politicians and businessmen) who had loans written-off by the major (now insolvent) banks; it appears the rot is far fouler than expected. In a somewhat stunning (or purely coincidental) revelation, ENETEnglish reports that Cypriot newspaper Haravgi claims that current President Nicos Anastasiades� family businesses transferred �dozens of millions� from their Laiki Bank accounts to London just a week before the devastating depositor haircuts were unleashed upon his people. Of course, the denials are loud and Anastasiades has demanded an investigation into the claims; we are sure the government-selected �independent� committee will be as thorough as the Libor anti-trust investigators. As a reminder, as we noted yesterday, here are Cyprus� gun control laws.Via EnetEnglish,A company owned by in-laws of Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades withdrew dozens of millions from Laiki Bank on March 12 and 13, according to an article published in Cypriot newspaper Haravgi.The newspaper, which is affiliated to the communist-rooted AKEL party, reports that three days before the Eurogroup meeting the company took five promissory notes worth �21m from Laiki Bank and transferred the money to London.Responding to the allegations, Anastasiades said: �The attempt to defame companies or people linked to my family� is nothing but an attempt to distract people from the liability of those who led the country to a state of bankruptcy.�The president added that no one, including himself, will be exempt from the ongoing investigations looking into responsibilities over the near collapse of the economy.Anastasiades added that when the investigative committee convenes on Tuesday, he will request that its members look into this particular case with the same attentiveness as all other cases.The company in question has firmly denied the reports.Last Friday a list of companies and politicians that had loans written off by banks at the heart of Cyprus� bailout crisis was published in Greece and was subsequently handed to the Cypriot parliament�s ethics committee. The list includes the names of politicians from Cyprus� biggest parties (excluding the socialist EDEK and the Greens).Anastasiades requests investigation into allegations against family membersA company owned by in-laws of Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades withdrew dozens of millions from Laiki Bank on March 12 and 13, according to an article published in Cypriot newspaper Haravgi.The newspaper, which is affiliated to the communist-rooted AKEL party, reports that three days before the Eurogroup meeting the company took five promissory notes worth �21m from Laiki Bank and transferred the money to London.Responding to the allegations, Anastasiades said: �The attempt to defame companies or people linked to my family� is nothing but an attempt to distract people from the liability of those who led the country to a state of bankruptcy.�The president added that no one, including himself, will be exempt from the ongoing investigations looking into responsibilities over the near collapse of the economy.Anastasiades added that when the investigative committee convenes on Tuesday, he will request that its members look into this particular case with the same attentiveness as all other cases.The company in question has firmly denied the reports.Last Friday a list of companies and politicians that had loans written off by banks at the heart of Cyprus' bailout crisis was published in Greece and was subsequently handed to the Cypriot parliament's ethics committee.

Cyprus will relax requirements for citizenship, including for bank depositors who lost large amounts of money in the deal with the EU and IMF, in an effort to keep foreigners interested in investing in the island state, the president said on Sunday.Cyprus was forced to wind down one major bank and impose considerable losses on large depositors in a second bank in return for 10 billion euros in aid from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in a move that was devastating to both Cypriots and foreign investors.Euro zone finance ministers approved the aid on Friday.In prepared remarks to Russian businesspeople in the port city of Limassol, President Nicos Anastasiades said his cabinet would this week approve the relaxation of restrictions on foreigners seeking citizenship of Cyprus, an EU member since 2004.Non-resident investors who held deposits prior to March 15, when the plan to impose losses on savers was first formulated, and who lost at least 3 million euros would be eligible to apply for Cypriot citizenship, he said.Cyprus's existing "citizenship by investment" program - similar to that of many countries - would be revised to reduce the amount of investment required to be eligible for the program to 3 million euros from the previous 10 million euros."These decisions will be deployed in a fast-track manner," Anastasiades said in the address.Other measures were also under consideration, he said, including offering tax incentives for existing or new companies doing business in Cyprus.Anastasiades, whose center-right government has been in power for less than two months, said countries who accused Cyprus of being a money laundering hub for businesses from countries such as Russia were being hypocrites, since those same countries were now trying to lure foreign businesses away.Used to robust growth and a thriving financial services sector, Cyprus is now bracing itself for record unemployment and at least a 12 percent drop in output this year.MODEL CRUMBLESCyprus, one of the euro zone's smallest economies, modeled itself as a competitively-taxed financial services center with a network of treaties to avoid double taxation.That model is now threatened by the fact that bailout conditions have left its two main banks crippled, but also forced Cyprus to increase its corporate tax to 12.5 percent from 10, which had been the lowest in the euro zone.The bailout, first requested in June 2012, was delayed partly because of concerns expressed by euro zone states, notably Germany, that its financial sector was opaque, thus aiding money laundering.But Cyprus was neither a money laundering hub or a tax haven, Anastasiades said."What saddens - I refrain from using the word angers - me deeply is that since the euro group agreement was reached, some EU partners' businesses involved in the financial services industry have been preying upon our financial services sector, in order to encourage a relocation of funds into their economies," he said.It was an irony and an "absurd paradox" that the governments of those businesses claimed those funds were deposited and invested in Cyprus through illicit means."I am a firm believer in the rules of the free market, but allow me to comment on the hypocrisy of such methods," Anastasiades said.Cyprus to ease citizenship rules for EU bailout losersCyprus is to relax its citizenship rules for foreign investors who lost at least 3m euros (�2.5m) under an EU bailout deal.President Nicos Anastasiades said new measures, mostly affecting the Russian business community, would be approved at a cabinet meeting on Monday.Russians have billions of euros in Cypriot bank deposits.Investors were angered when it emerged they would lose up to 60% of their savings under the terms of the bailout.In order to secure the 10bn euros, agreed by the EU and IMF, Cyprus was forced to wind up one major bank and write-off of a large portion of secured debt and uninsured deposits in the largest bank, Bank of Cyprus.Speaking at a Russian business conference in the coastal resort of Limassol, President Anastasiades said the new measures would "mitigate to some extent the damage" Russian investors had endured.Cyprus has been a member of the EU since 2004. It sealed an EU bailout last month to save it from bankruptcy.President Anastasiades said foreign investors who held deposits prior to 15 March, and who lost at least 3m euros would be eligible to apply for Cypriot citizenship.Cyprus's existing "citizenship by investment" programme will also be revised to reduce the amount of investment required to be eligible from 10m euros to 3m.The president said he would also drop requirements for citizenship applicants to keep 15m euros in Cypriot banks for five years, saying they would be allowed immediate access to their money."These decisions will be deployed in a fast-track manner," President Anastasiades said.The Cypriot economy is worth about 18bn euros, which accounts for less than 0.2% of the eurozone total.Cost of euro bailout to Britain soars to �22billionIncrease is on top of �12.5bn Britain has already committed to EurozoneMP Douglas Carswell accuses government of being 'caught out' over plans detailed in low-key orderTreasury insists IMF increase was agreed by Labour government in 2009Greek PM's plans to reshuffle government in disarray after spate of resignationsViolent clashes in Athens see 60 injured - including 36 policeStock markets across Europe fall sharply and euro slumps to $1.4072Sarkozy calls on Euro governments to put national fights behind themBritain's Treasury has been accused of sneaking through an extra contribution to the International Monetary Fund of �9.2billion.The IMF increase, detailed in a low-key government order, is on top of the �12.5billion Britain has already committed to protecting the Eurozone.The figures were discovered by Conservative MP Douglas Carswell, who accused Chancellor George Osborne of going back on assurances that bailouts would not cost taxpayers.They emerged on a day that violent riots broke out in Greece over anti-austerity measures being debated by the country's parliament.Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Athens, sparking clashes with riot police that left more than 60 people injured and at least fifteen arrested.Up to 5,000 riot police used stun grenades and tear gas during running battles through the streets of the capital.The people are unhappy over plans to introduce new austerity measures that Greece needs to comply with the terms of the 110billion euro bailout package it signed in May 2010.Greece's ailing economy could be in line for another �18billion bailout from the EU and IMF amid concerns it could default on the first deal.It is not known how much of that figure Britain is liable for, but the money would come from the extra contribution made to the IMF.Ms Osborne has already overseen �7billion given to Ireland during its bailout, along with �4.3billion handed to Portugal.Britain is also liable for around �1.2billion of the original Greece bailout - a total of �21.7billion, including the increased IMF contribution, to help prop up the Eurozone.Mr Carsell, MP for Harwich, told The Sun: 'The Government has given us cast-iron assurances that bailouts would not cost British taxpayers.'Now they've been caught out trying to sneak through plans that will cost the UK an extra �9.2billion.'This money could be funding tax cuts for hard-working families or more police on our streets.'But the Treasury rejects the claims, saying the increased contribution to the IMF was first announced by the Labour government in 2009.A spokesman told the newspaper: 'This gets all the facts wrong on the UK's membership of the IMF and seems to suggest that we should not be part of the IMF, which the Government totally rejects.'Moves to increase the IMF's resources were first agreed by the G20 in April 2009, before any Eurozone support packages.'It comes as Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou is set to reshuffle his government today in a desperate bid to force through austerity measures and prevent the country descending into economic chaos.The embattled politician is attempting to win support for tax hikes and service cuts that sparked the violent clashes yesterday.But he faces strong opposition from within his own party over the measures and rival politicians calling for an early election.Mr Papandreou has said the formation of a unity government requires agreement from all opposition parties on the cuts and privatisations.He said: 'The country is facing critical times. Today I made new proposals to the leaders of all parties to achieve the necessary national consensus.'I clarified that my responsibility has no dependence on official posts.'The main opposition party - New Democracy - has repeatedly demanded that he quit and that a cross-party coalition renegotiate the terms of the bailout package.As many as 30,000 protesters flooded Athens' streets yesterday, hurling firebombs, stones and even yoghurt at buildings and police.Protester Christos Miliadakis, 35, told CNN: 'When will we be able to get out of this vicious circle?'My wife lost her job. I had a 12 per cent pay cut as a result of the first bailout. The new measures want to cut another 20 per cent of jobs in the public sector.'So if no one has money and we are just more in debt, who is going to drive the economy? We will live like slaves paying all our lives.'Student Maria Iliadi, 23, added: 'The future in this country has been erased.'There will be no big public projects, and no one will be building for a long time. Sometimes, finishing my degree seems totally pointless.'Labour unions were holding a 24-hour strike over the proposed cuts, bringing public services to a halt and affecting transport networks.Unemployment in Greece has soared to more than 16 per cent - a 40 per cent rise on last year.The European Commission has said Greece's economy was expected to shrink by 3.5 per cent this year and credit rating agency Standard & Poor's cut its rating to 'CCC' - among the lowest in the world.Experts fear the country may end up defaulting on its debts which could set off a financial chain reaction described as potentially catastrophic.Greece has until the end of the month to pave the way for cuts demanded by the EU and IMF if it wants to receive the final installment of last year's bailout package.French President Nicolas Sarkozy today called on other EU leaders to stop squabbling over how to help Greece.He said: 'What we need most today, is unity. We have to leave the national fights behind us to find our sense of common destiny again.'Over the last few weeks, policymakers have been at loggerheads over how to get the private sector to make a substantial contribution in any new package.Greek debt fears sink Wall Street, more losses eyedStocks tumbled on Wednesday, driven lower by escalating Greek debt woes, while troubling U.S. data pointed to further losses ahead.Financials came under fire after Moody's Investors Service said it may cut the credit ratings of French banks, citing exposure to Greek debt.U.S. data showed the U.S. economy is facing a troubling mix of higher prices and weak growth."Every day that we get another negative macro report -- they can't keep brushing it under the rug and say we are in a soft patch and it's only temporary," said Ken Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York."They tried to play the Greece thing off like it was going to be settled and clearly it's not, so it's all coming back to haunt them."The day's losses left the S&P 500 within a stone's throw of its 200-day moving average of 1,256.82.

Fifty police officers were injured and at least 70 protesters were hospitalized. Sixth-seven suspected rioters were arrested and a further 70 detained.Leaders reactPrime Minister Lucas Papademos urged calm."Vandalism and destruction have no place in a democracy and will not be tolerated," Papademos told Parliament just before the vote. "I call on the public to show calm. At these crucial times, we do not have the luxury of this type of protest. I think everyone is aware of how serious the situation is."Since May 2010, Greece has survived on a �110 billion ($146 billion) bailout from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund. When that proved insufficient, the new rescue package was approved. The deal, which has not yet been finalized, will be combined with a massive bond swap deal to write off half the country's privately held debt.But for both deals to materialize, Greece had to persuade its deeply skeptical creditors that it has the will to implement spending cuts and public sector reforms that will end years of fiscal profligacy and tame gaping budget deficits.'Once again, the city is being used as a lever to try to destabilize the country.'�Athens Mayor Giorgos KaminisAs protests raged Sunday, demonstrators set bonfires in front of parliament and dozens of riot police formed lines to keep them from making a run on the building. Security forces fired dozens of tear gas volleys at rioters, who attacked them with firebombs and chunks of marble broken off the fronts of luxury hotels, banks and department stores.Clouds of tear gas drifted across the square, and many in the crowd wore gas masks or had their faces covered, while others carried Greek flags and banners. Masked rioters also attacked a police station with petrol bombs and stones.A three-story building was completely consumed by flames as firefighters struggled to douse the blaze. Streets were strewn with stones, smashed glass and burnt wreckage, while terrified passers-by sought refuge in hotel lounges and cafeterias.Chaos on streets of AthensScores of bat-wielding youths smashed property at will for several hours, leaving broken traffic lights hanging from poles, and chairs and tables from looted coffee shops dumped on the street. Ambulances weaved through narrow backstreets to ferry the injured to hospital, dodging burning trash bins and the running battles between rioters and police."I've had it! I can't take it any more. There's no point in living in this country any more," said a distraught shop owner walking through his smashed and looted optician store.Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis said rioters tried to storm the City Hall building, but were repelled. "Once again, the city is being used as a lever to try to destabilize the country," he said.In parliament, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the new austerity measures were vital to the country's very economic survival."The question is not whether some salaries and pensions will be curtailed, but whether we will be able to pay even these reduced wages and pensions," he told lawmakers before the vote. "When you have to choose between bad and worse, you will pick what is bad to avoid what is worse."The new cutbacks, which follow two years of harsh income losses and tax hikes amid a deep recession and record high unemployment have been demanded by Greece's bailout creditors in return for a new batch of vital rescue loans.Not Out of The Woods Yet: Despite Progress, Euro Crisis Is Far From OverThe Greek debt cut worked and the rescue package has gone through. So is the euro crisis over? By no means. The situation in Greece will take a turn for the worse again in a few weeks. The other euro nations will have to use the time until then to get their own houses in order -- especially Germany.For a change, everything has been going according to plan in the fight to save the euro in recent weeks. On Wednesday, euro-zone finance ministers gave the green light to the �130 billion ($170 billion) second rescue package for Greece. It's a pure formality after a satisfyingly large proportion of creditors agreed to a debt cut for Greece. Perhaps the most significant success of recent days is that even though the debt cut was deemed a so-called credit event, triggering the payment of the financial contracts known as credit default swaps, hardly anyone seemed to care.For more than two years, the international financial lobby had been warning the public and governments that these credit default swaps must under no circumstances be triggered, because that would cause a disaster similar to the meltdown that followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. Their message, effectively, was that taxpayers should cover all the losses, rather than private-sector creditors. But the CDS horror scenario has failed to become reality.So has Greece been rescued and financial markets been tamed? Is the euro crisis a thing of the past? Unfortunately not. With their successes in the last few days, euro-zone politicians have done little more than bought themselves time. They must use this window to brace themselves for the next wave of the euro crisis which is about to crash down on Europe.It's already clear that the Greek economy can't survive with a government debt to GDP ratio that will -- at best -- still be at 117 percent in 2020, especially given the record pace at which the country's GDP is contracting. There is still no coherent strategy for making Greece competitive again inside the euro zone, or for raising the capital for the huge investments needed -- let alone for the wholesale revamp of the country's entire public administration.Greek Crisis Will Escalate AgainAnd so Greece is likely to report the next set of disappointing budget figures in a few months, and the wrangling over a new debt cut and a new rescue package will start shortly afterwards. Maybe the next wave of the crisis will hit us even sooner: Greece is scheduled to hold an election on April 22 which is expected to produce a left-wing majority deeply opposed to the strict austerity program imposed by Brussels.The other euro-zone governments have at most a few more months, perhaps only a few weeks, before the situation in Greece worsens again. They must use this time to make clear that Greece is the exception within the euro zone, not the rule. The other euro states must quickly arrive at a point at which the fate of Greece simply isn't relevant for the future of the euro -- which of course doesn't mean that the Greeks should be left to their fate.That means that Portugal, Spain and Italy, the three other problem countries in the south of the euro zone, must perform the magic trick of stimulating growth while reducing their budget deficits. That can only succeed with a lot of pragmatism -- austerity without growth is as pointless as growth without austerity.That pragmatism also means that the other European finance ministers should keep calm in reaction to the news that Spain has revised up its projected 2012 budget deficit to 5.8 percent from a previously forecast 4.4 percent. Spain, too, is in a deep recession. It is an impressive feat even to have reduced new borrowing at all -- in 2011, Spain's budget deficit was 8.5 percent of GDP.Beyond DoubtIt is petty of the Euro Group to insist that the country curb its 2012 deficit to 5.3 percent. What is far more important is the message: Rome, Madrid and Lisbon are heading in the right direction with their reforms. Italy, Spain and Portugal have -- unlike Greece -- competitive industrial sectors, a functioning public administration and a political consensus, admittedly fragile, that they have to pull themselves out of the mess they got themselves into by running up debts over years.Germany itself doesn't warrant such tolerance. The country is the euro zone's growth engine and its anchor of stability. If the debt crisis escalates again and engulfs other states, everything will depend on Germany -- and the long-term stability of Germany's finances must be beyond any doubt.Germany's tax revenues are at a record high and the interest it has to pay on new debt is close to zero. Despite this, Germany still missed its own cost-cutting targets in 2011 and is also falling behind on its goals for 2012. Before Germany admonishes Spain about its budget, it must make a greater effort itself.Greek austerity measures could violate human rights, UN expert says30 June 2011 � The United Nations independent expert on foreign debt and human rights warned today that the austerity measures and structural reforms proposed to solve Greece�s debt crisis may result in violations of the basic human rights of the country�s people, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported.�The implementation of the second package of austerity measures and structural reforms, which includes a wholesale privatization of state-owned enterprises and assets, is likely to have a serious impact on basic social services and therefore the enjoyment of human rights by the Greek people, particularly the most vulnerable sectors of the population such as the poor, elderly, unemployed and persons with disabilities,� said Cephas Lumina, who reports to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.�The rights to food, water, adequate housing and work under fair and equitable conditions should not be compromised by the implementation of austerity measures,� he said, urging the Government to �strike a careful balance between austerity and the realization of human rights, taking into account the primacy of States� human rights obligations.�Mr. Lumina also called upon the authorities to maintain some fiscal leeway to meet its people�s basic human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights.�Tax rises, public expenditure cuts and privatization measures have to be implemented in such a way that they do not result in unbearable suffering of the people,� he said.�Debts can only be paid out of income,� Mr. Lumina said. �A shrinking economy cannot generate any revenue and contributes to a reduced capacity to repay the debt. More time should have been allowed for the restructuring measures already in place to work.�The independent expert also called on the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union (EU) and the European Central Bank (ECB) to remain aware of the human rights impact of the policies they design in attempting to resolve the sovereign debt crises in Greece and other countries.�There will be no lasting solution to the sovereign debt problem if the human rights of the people are not taken into account,� said Mr. Lumina, who serves in an unpaid capacity.Supporters of Bailout Claim Victory in Greek ElectionATHENS � Greek voters on Sunday gave a narrow victory in parliamentary elections to a party that had supported a bailout for the country�s failed economy. The vote was widely seen as a last chance for Greece to remain in the euro zone, and the results had an early rallying effect on world markets.Greece�s choice was welcomed by the finance ministers of the euro zone countries, who in a statement on Sunday night in Brussels said the outcome of the vote �should allow for the formation of a government that will carry the support of the electorate to bring Greece back on a path of sustainable growth.�While the election afforded Greece a brief respite from a rapid downward spiral, it is not likely to prevent a showdown between the next government and the country�s so-called troika of foreign creditors � the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund � over the terms of a bailout agreement.Even the most pro-Europe of Greece�s political parties, the conservative New Democracy, which came in first, has said a less austere agreement is crucial to a country with a 22 percent unemployment rate and the rising prospect of social unrest.The euro zone ministers pledged to help Greece transform its economy and said continued fiscal and structural changes were the best way to cope with its economic challenges. �The Eurogroup reiterates its commitment to assist Greece in its adjustment effort in order to address the many challenges the economy is facing,� the statement said.The ministers added that representatives of Greece�s creditors would discuss emergency loans and changes as soon as a government was in place. Much of the negotiations are expected to fall to Germany, a strong proponent of austerity. It and other euro zone countries must also consider the needs of the larger economies of Spain and Italy, which are also under intense pressure.Official projections showed New Democracy with 30 percent of the vote and 128 seats in the 300-seat Parliament. The Syriza party, which had surged on a wave of anti-austerity sentiment and spooked Europe with its talk of tearing up Greece�s loan agreement with its foreign creditors, was in second place, with 27 percent of the vote and 72 seats. Syriza officials had rejected calls for a coalition, ensuring its role as a vocal opposition bloc to whatever government emerges.But unlike in the May 6 election, when New Democracy placed first but was unable to form a government, this time intense international pressure, and the fact that the Greek government is quickly running out of money, made it likely there would be a coalition with New Democracy�s longtime rival, the socialist Pasok party. Pasok placed third in the voting, with 12 percent of the vote and 33 seats. The extreme right Golden Dawn party got 18 seats.Investors gave an early thumbs-up on Sunday night, pushing up the euro in value against the dollar. �It looks like we�ve avoided the worst-case scenario,� said Darren Williams, a European economist for AllianceBernstein in London. �I think that�s important, because we could have gone to a very bad place very quickly.�Continue reading the main storyPrevious rallies in response to developments in Europe were short-lived. A few weeks ago, markets initially responded positively to a bailout plan for Spanish banks, but that optimism quickly gave out when the American stock markets opened that Monday.The health of the world economy weighs heavily on the United States, and on President Obama�s re-election campaign. In recent days, Mr. Obama has increased the pressure on European leaders to find longer-term solutions to shoring up the euro. A White House statement on Sunday said, �As President Obama and other world leaders have said, we believe that it is in all our interests for Greece to remain in the euro area while respecting its commitment to reform.�In a sign of the high stakes for global financial stability, the finance ministers, the White House and the European Commission urged Greek political leaders to form a government quickly. Under the current loan agreement, the next government has just weeks to determine how to slash the equivalent of 5 percent of the country�s gross domestic product to meet budget-reduction targets.In a victory statement on Sunday evening, the New Democracy leader, Antonis Samaras, called for the formation of a government of national unity aimed at keeping Greece in the euro zone and renegotiating the loan agreement. �There is no time for political games. The country must be governed,� he said, adding, �We will cooperate with our European partners to boost growth and tackle the torturous problem of unemployment.�Alexis Tsipras, the 37-year-old leader of Syriza, conceded defeat. �We fought against blackmail to put an end to memorandum,� he said, referring to the loan agreement. �We�re proud of our fight.�PhotoA woman cast her ballot at a polling station in Athens on Sunday. Credit John Kolesidis/ReutersHe added that Syriza would be �present in developments from the position of the main opposition party.�Any new leader will face an uphill battle to inject confidence into a paralyzed Greek economy that depends heavily on the continued infusion of money from its only remaining lifeline, the European Central Bank. The Greek economy and a deficit-ridden government have lost most of their ability to raise new revenues or borrow money to continue operations.But political analysts said no matter what government was formed, it would be weak and likely short-lived, lacking deep popular support and the broader confidence of Europe. And it was unlikely that the election results would persuade Greece�s European lenders to extend loans without economic reforms and drastic spending cuts.Mr. Samaras �won a Pyrrhic victory,� said Harry Papasotiriou, a political-science professor at Panteion University in Athens. �New Democracy will try to renegotiate part of the memorandum agreement, but they won�t get far, and then they will have to implement within 100 days a very difficult program of reforms. And the unions of the public sector, supported by the radical left, will give him a hard time.�Asked what the election results change, Daniel Gros, the director of the Centre for European Policy Studies, which is based in Brussels, said, �Unfortunately nothing.� He said the government would most likely not be strong enough to enact the structural changes needed to turn around Greece�s uncompetitive economy.Continue reading the main storyMeanwhile, Greece�s partners in the euro zone are growing impatient. �I think there�s no desire for them to leave, but very little inclination to say, �Let�s give them still another chance� and give any substantial compromise on the rescue package,� Mr. Gros said.For many Greeks, the election was a choice between hope and fear. Syriza had billed itself as a kind of �Greek Spring,� capturing the momentum of those hungry for change at almost any cost from a political system that is widely seen as corrupt and ineffective. It also had support from voters who felt betrayed by the socialists, whose party was in power in 2010 when Greece signed the first of its two loan deals with foreign creditors.New Democracy tapped into different fears � of the unknown, of illegal immigration, of an exit from the euro zone. Its main campaign advertisement showed an elementary-school teacher telling his students which countries use the euro. When one asks, �And what about Greece?� the teacher stares back in stony silence. �Why, teacher, why?� the student asks.In the end, fear of imminent collapse, as opposed to the slow death of their economy and society, appeared to drive a majority of Greeks to New Democracy.As he watched election returns at an outdoor cafe here, Nikos Theodossiades, 69, said he was glad that New Democracy had won. �This is the only way for the country to move forward,� he said. �Staying in the euro zone, despite all its problems, is much better than the alternative.�Panagiotis Pierrakis, 48, an Athens taxi driver, said that he had voted for Syriza and that although it did not win, he thought the results had sent a message. The election, he said, was �a message� to Europe that �you are not the boss � Mrs. Merkel, or anybody,� a reference Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. �We want somebody from our country to oversee our economic system.�Pro-bailout parties secure Greek majorityGreek political parties supporting a bailout for the country have won enough seats in the country's latest parliamentary elections to form a joint government.Near complete results early on Monday showed the conservative New Democracy party gaining about 30 per cent of the vote and 129 seats in the 300-seat parliament, including a bonus 50 seats for finishing first, while the pro-bailout Socialist PASOK party came in third with about 12 per cent and 33 seats.The leftist Syriza party, which had become the standard bearer for the anti-bailout cause, gained almost 27 per cent and 71 seats, while the far-right Golden Dawn party had 6.9 per cent of the vote, earning 18 seats.Sunday's vote, which followed an inconclusive ballot on May 6, was seen as crucial for Europe and the world, since it could determine whether Greece was forced to leave the joint euro currency, a move that analysts say would have potentially catastrophic consequences for other ailing European nations and the global economy.Click here to follow our Greece elections live blog"The Greek people today voted for Greece to remain on its European path and in the eurozone," said Antonis Samaras, the New Democracy leader, adding that voters chose "policies that will bring jobs, growth, justice and security".Al Jazeera's Barnaby Phillips, reporting from Athens, said the demographic division over economic policy between different age groups was quite dramatic, with younger voters far more likely to vote for Syriza, while older Greeks were more conservative.Youth vote"The youth went for Syriza, and when you look at Greece's youth unemployment, that's understandable," he said.Alexis Tsipras, Syriza's leader, conceded defeat late in the day, saying his party would not join a New Democracy-led government and would continue to oppose the bailout."We represent a majority of people opposed to the bailout deal," said Tsipras. ""We will be present in these developments from the position of the main opposition."Greece has been dependent on rescue loans totalling $300bn since May 2010 after sky-high borrowing rates left it locked out of the international markets and unable to meet debt payments.The spending cuts made in return have left the country mired in a fifth year of recession, with unemployment rising to above 22 per cent and tens of thousands of businesses shutting down.Virtually unknown outside of Greece four months ago, Tsipras and his party shot to prominence in the May 6 vote, where he came a surprise second and quadrupled his support since the 2009 election on the back of public frustration with traditionally dominant New Democracy and PASOK and their failure to address the country's financial travails.Tsipras had vowed to tear up Greece's bailout agreements and repeal the austerity measures, which have included deep spending cuts on everything from health care to education and infrastructure, as well as tax hikes and reductions of salaries and pensions.Samaras, for his part, cast the choice as one between the euro and returning to the drachma. He pledged to renegotiate some of the bailout's harsher terms but insists the top priority is for the country to remain in Europe's joint currency.'New era' for GreeceOpinion polls pitted the anti-bailout party Syriza against pro-bailout New Democracy [GALLO/GETTY]"Today the Greek people speak. Tomorrow a new era for Greece begins," Samaras said after voting in southern Greece.Earlier on Sunday, about 10 men armed with sledgehammers and wooden bats attacked a polling station in central Athens, wounding two policemen guarding it and setting fire to the ballot box shortly before polls closed.The attack - the only one reported so far - took place in the Athens neighbourhood of Exarhia, a traditional haven for leftists and anarchists.Greek police were also investigating the discovery on Sunday of two unexploded hand grenades outside private Skai television station on the outskirts of Athens.Demetris Tsiodras, the Greek government spokesperson, denounced the devices as an attempt to spoil the smooth running of the election.Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's finance minister, called New Democracy's victory a decision to "forge ahead" with implementing far-reaching reforms.Schaeuble said it was important for Greece to stick to its agreements with creditors, but held out the prospect that Athens might be given more time to comply with them.Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has been a major contributor to Greece's two rescue packages and a key advocate of demanding tough austerity conditions.Antonis Samaras begins urgent Greece coalition talksThe leader of the party that narrowly won Greece's election has begun urgent talks to form a coalition, saying he wants to forge a "national consensus".New Democracy's Antonis Samaras met leaders of the other two largest parties, but no deal on a coalition has yet been announced.Mr Samaras says he will seek changes in the terms of a bailout agreement reached with the EU and IMF.Market responses to the poll result were mixed and bank stocks plummeted.Mr Samaras called for a "national understanding" as he met President Karolos Papoulias earlier to be given a formal mandate.Under the constitution, Mr Papoulias has given Mr Samaras three days to form a government.Mr Samaras said he believed he could form a working coalition.Initial market rallies quickly reversed, suggesting that the election had not been enough to persuade markets that the euro problem was under control.Germany's Commerzbank was down 3.6% and France's BNP down 3.3%, with analysts saying much uncertainty remained.Spanish government borrowing costs rose to a euro-era high, with 10-year bonds reaching 7.144%.The BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens says Mr Samaras will push for a lightening of the bailout terms from Brussels, arguing that Greeks have accepted more pain by electing a pro-bailout party and that Europe should now cut Greece some slack.German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged the future government to live up to its obligations, and said any weakening of reform pledges previously made by Greece would be unacceptable."Elections cannot call into question the commitments Greece made. We cannot compromise on the reform steps we agreed on," she told reporters ahead of the G20 summit in Mexico.Earlier, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle suggested that the timeframe could be discussed.'Best guarantee'Mr Samaras met the leader of Syriza, Alexis Tsipras, after talking to the president.Mr Tsipras said Syriza would remain in opposition and challenge the government, as his party had "different priorities".Jump media playerMedia player helpOut of media player. Press enter to return or tab to continue.Media caption European leaders cautiously welcomed the Greek election results"The role of a strong and responsible opposition... is to intervene in a powerful way and this is what I assured Mr Samaras that we would do."However, he said Syriza would not be an obstacle to the formation of a government by New Democracy, which he said was in accordance with the mandate of the people.Despite Mr Tsipras's opposition, Mr Samaras said: "We need a national salvation government with as many parties as possible."Mr Samaras later met Evangelos Venizelos, whose socialist Pasok party came third in the election."The country needs a government right away and the negotiations must be wrapped up tomorrow," the Pasok leader told reporters after the meeting.Those two parties should be able to form a majority coalition, but our correspondent says Mr Samaras wants the broader grouping to try to create a stable government with a stronger popular mandate.With almost all ballots counted, New Democracy has 29.7% of the vote (129 seats), Syriza 26.9% (71) and Pasok 12.3% (33).There are 300 seats in parliament and Greece has a rule that gives the leading party 50 extra seats.However, correspondents point out that only 40% of voters backed parties that broadly support the bailout deal with the EU and the IMF.Nevertheless, many world leaders hailed the election result.In a statement on behalf of the 17 eurozone finance ministers, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Paul Juncker said that "continued fiscal and structural reforms are Greece's best guarantee to overcome the current economic and social challenges and for a more prosperous future of Greece in the euro area"Greek leader seeks 'salvation' governmentConservative party claims to have preliminary agreement with socialists to form "government of national salvation".Greece is engaged in second day of coalition talks under pressure from financial markets and world powers after elections won by pro-euro parties that also reflected rising anger against austerity.The New Democracy conservatives who came first in the elections said they had struck a preliminary agreement with the socialists PASOK to form "a government of national salvation" to rescue Greece from its devastating economic crisis.PASOK has voiced hope for a deal later on Tuesday but insists that the new government should include other parties including the leftist Syriza, which has already ruled out taking part in any New Democracy-led coalition.Greece's victorious conservative leader has pledged to soften the debt-laden country's punishing austerity programe despite opposition from Germany.A brief relief rally on international financial markets after Sunday's Greek vote quickly fizzled out as it became clear that Antonis Samaras's New Democracy had failed to win a convincing popular mandate to implement the deep spending cuts and tax increases demanded by the European Union and the IMF.Syriza and a host of smaller parties opposed to the punishing conditions attached to the $164.12bn bailout won around half the votes cast, though fewer seats because the electoral system rewards the first placed party disproportionately.Samaras received a mandate to form a coalition government from the president on Monday, and said the country would meet its bailout commitments.But he said: "We will simultaneously have to make some necessary amendments to the bailout agreement, in order to relieve the people of crippling unemployment and huge hardships."Deep-seated divisionsAl Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from Athens, whose atmosphere he compared to that of a "tinderbox", said any new government would have to contend with deep-seated political and demographic divisions."The real worry is that if there's a weak government, Syriza is going to weigh in and bring it down," he said.He said that a government would likely be formed and that there was unlikely to be a repeat of the standoff that followed the May elections.Greece's caretaker government says the state hasenough cash to last a few weeks [AFP]Evangelos Venizelos, PASOK head and a former finance minister, finished in the election behind Syriza.But his 33 seats in the 300-member parliament mean he could form a government with New Democracy, which gained 129 seats.Syriza has refused to join the other two parties in a government, saying it will not cooperate with any group that insists on implementing the harsh austerity measures taken in return for Greece's two international bailout agreements.Venizelos, however, insisted on a broad coalition."The most crucial thing for us right now is to achieve the greatest possible range of consensus, and this must happen by tomorrow night at the latest," he said after meeting with New Democracy head Antonis Samaras, who as election winner has the first go at trying to form a government.Venizelos criticized Syriza chief Alexis Tsipras for his refusal to join in governing Greece, which has been wracked by a financial crisis that has left it dependent on international loans since May 2010."You can't have some people choosing the easy position of being in opposition and lying in wait for the government to fail - or rather trying to create the conditions for the government, that is the country, to fail," Venizelos said.Mixed moodOn the streets of Athens, the mood was mixed, with many saying party leaders must get their act together."The election result isn't strong enough to put people's minds at ease," said sandwich shop owner Mary Moutafidis, 57. "They still have to agree to form a government."Greece's economy is forecast to contract five per cent this year after shrinking seven per cent last year.Click here to follow our Greece elections live blogProtests regularly choke the centre of Athens, some hospitals are running short of medicines, thousands of businesses have closed and beggars and rough sleepers are multiplying.During the election campaign, Samaras called for cuts in taxes, rises in unemployment benefits, pension rises and two more years to meet fiscal targets.But Germany, already irritated at what it sees as the slow pace of Greek reform, ruled out more than minor delays to some targets in the rescue package - Greece's second since 2010.Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at a meeting of G20 leaders in Mexico, said any loosening of Greece's agreed reform pledges would be unacceptable and reiterated that Athens had to stick to the commitments it had already made.Samaras voted in 2010 against the first 110bn euro rescue because he thought it was too harsh. He now says Greece should have until 2016, not 2014, to meet fiscal targets set by under the bailout. His most likely ally, Socialist PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos, wants a further year to reform.The small Democratic Left party indicated it would also be ready to support Samaras if the bailout deal could be softened. Samaras and Venizelos began talks at 15:00 GMT.Samaras Takes Office as Greece�s Prime Minister, Facing Major ChallengesATHENS � Antonis Samaras has worked his entire life to become prime minister of Greece. But now that he has achieved his dream job, the biggest question among both his friends and his enemies is how long he will be able to hold on to it.On Wednesday, Mr. Samaras, the leader of the New Democracy party, was sworn into office, ushering in a new coalition government that will put Greece back at Europe�s bargaining table and ending a seven-week leadership vacuum that had destabilized this already fragile nation and cast a shadow over the euro zone�s future.�I am fully aware of the critical moments we face as a country,� Mr. Samaras said during the transfer from the caretaker prime minister, Panagiotis Pikrammenos, adding that the Greek people were �injured� and needed �healing.�Continue reading the main storyRelated CoverageWiggle Room Emerges in Greece�s Bailout DealJUNE 19, 2012But with Greece�s economy at a standstill and European leaders still uncertain about the country�s fate, Mr. Samaras, a pro-European nationalist known for his stubbornness as well as his tactical shrewdness, comes into power with little room for maneuvering and scant chance of comforting Greeks.PhotoAntonis Samaras, the head of the New Democracy party, was sworn in as prime minister.

Mr. Samaras, 61, must wrest enough concessions from Brussels in easing the terms of Greece�s austerity agreement to pacify the Greek public. Simultaneously, he needs to pursue root-and-branch changes to his nation�s sclerotic economy and dysfunctional government to persuade Germany and Greece�s other foreign lenders to keep Athens�s financial lifeline in place.And he must do so while presiding over an unruly coalition that includes his longtime rivals, the Socialist party, Pasok, and a smaller left-wing party, who have little common ground besides a deep desire to prevent Greece from collapse.While European leaders had publicly hoped for a victory by New Democracy over the more radical Syriza, which had pledged to renounce Greece�s bailout agreement, privately some officials say that Mr. Samaras will have to work hard to regain trust and good will, given his strident opposition to Greece�s first bailout deal and his weeks of foot-dragging last autumn before agreeing to go along with the second.�He�s an awkward customer, more interested in himself than solving the crisis,� one European Union official in Brussels said on the condition of anonymity. �Now, of course, they�re the same thing, so we�ll work with him. He has a vested interest in making sure a bad situation doesn�t get worse.�Continue reading the main storyRelated in OpinionOp-Ed Contributors: The European Central Bank Needs More PowerJUNE 20, 2012Many Greek voters switched parties to support Mr. Samaras as their last hope to save the country from ejection from the euro zone. Mr. Samaras ran on a platform promising to change the policy mix in the loan agreement by reversing some tax increases and rescinding cuts to pensions. But he did not convincingly specify where the extra money would come from in a country whose coffers are expected to run dry as soon as mid-July.Continue reading the main storyIn some ways, Mr. Samaras has been vindicated. He steadfastly insisted that Greece needed more growth and that the austerity medicine prescribed by international creditors was making the country�s problems worse.�Although he comes from the conservative background of New Democracy, he has an open mind on both sides of the spectrum,� said Chrysanthos Lazaridis, a member of Parliament from New Democracy and one of Mr. Samaras�s close advisers. As a trained economist, he added, Mr. Samaras favors �allowing market forces to do their job � without letting social cohesion unravel.�Critics say that Mr. Samaras destabilized Greece with his insistence on calling elections to replace the government led by Lucas Papademos, the technocratic prime minister whose mandate was to sign Greece�s second loan agreement.�He just wanted to be prime minister,� said Thanos Veremis, a political historian who said he voted for New Democracy as a last resort. �It was pure ambition, pure and simple. Even in this state of collapse, he wanted to be Nero, playing his harp.�The new Greek government came together just a day before European finance ministers are to gather in Luxembourg on Thursday to discuss Greece�s latest troubles. George Zanias, the departing finance minister, is expected to represent Greece at the meeting, holding the fort for Vasilios Rapanos, the president of the National Bank of Greece, who is expected to be named Greece�s finance minister.In a sign of the challenges the new government will face, Evangelos Venizelos, the Pasok leader and a former finance minister who negotiated Greece�s second debt deal, said his party would support the government in Parliament but not contribute any politicians to the new cabinet. That was clearly seen as an effort to avoid blame for any additional austerity measures. Leaders of the Democratic Left, the third coalition partner, made similar statements.Some of those who know Mr. Samaras say he is ill equipped for the complex task of managing a coalition government. �He�s kind of stubborn in the sense that he�s not flexible and not a good negotiator,� said George Kirtsos, a high school classmate of Mr. Samaras who ran for office with the hard-right Popular Orthodox Rally party, which did not win enough seats to enter Parliament. �But that could change, of course.�It already may have. �Samaras today is completely different than what he was two weeks ago,� Mr. Kirtsos said. �Two weeks ago, he was very negative about cooperating with Pasok.�Educated at Athens College, an elite high school, Mr. Samaras, like many Greek politicians, has spent his entire career in office, with no experience outside government. He was first elected to Parliament at age 26 in 1976, after receiving an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and an undergraduate degree in economics from Amherst College.At Amherst, in Massachusetts, he lived in the same dormitory as George A. Papandreou, the former Socialist prime minister whose efforts to persuade Mr. Samaras to join an emergency coalition last June failed, soon toppling the government and setting off an acute phase of the euro crisis.Continue reading the main storySince the fall of a military dictatorship in 1974, Greek politics has been dominated by three families � the Papandreou family for the Socialists and the Mitsotakis and Karamanlis families with New Democracy � that have alternated in power. Mr. Samaras has long played the role of the ambitious outsider.As Greece�s foreign minister in 1992, Mr. Samaras signed the Maastricht Treaty, which set the criteria for the single currency. But that year, he was ousted from the government of Constantinos Mitsotakis for bitterly opposing allowing the former Yugoslav Republic of Macadonia to call itself Macedonia, the name of a bordering northern Greek region. (The issue still has not been resolved.) Mr. Samaras set up his own party, Political Spring, setting off the collapse of the Mitsotakis government in 1993.Mr. Samaras then stayed on the sidelines of Greek politics for more than a decade, forming his own small party before returning to New Democracy in 2004 and rejoining the Parliament. In 2009, he defeated Dora Bakoyannis, the daughter of Mr. Mitsotakis, to become party leader. Last year, he kicked her out of the party for supporting the loan agreement, only to reconcile with her after the May 6 elections. Although his campaign rhetoric has often been fiery, in person Mr. Samaras is soft-spoken, reflective and a bit introverted.Mr. Samaras is a descendant of two well-established families in Greece. His father was a cardiology professor, and his mother was the granddaughter of Penelope Delta, a beloved Greek writer who took her own life on April 27, 1941, the day the Nazis invaded Athens.Mr. Samaras recounted that grim episode in a campaign speech on April 27, sounding a nationalist note that resonated with Greeks who believe the country�s loan deal represents a loss of sovereignty to Germany. In an election in which the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, known for its violent scuffles with immigrants, won 18 seats in Parliament, Mr. Samaras also tacked hard to the right on immigration issues. In his final campaign rally, he said that his party would kick illegal immigrants out of Greece�s public squares, as supporters waved Greek flags.Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament and a German, captured Europe�s wariness toward the new Greek prime minister. �Mr. Samaras has not made himself known for his reliable comments,� Mr. Schulz told German public television. �In the past, he was one of those who rejected all reform measures proposed by George Papandreou.�But Mr. Schulz said he believed Mr. Samaras was capable of forming a government that could work with European leaders. �I trust him to become a responsible partner,� Mr. Schulz said.Much is riding on whether Mr. Samaras can pull together the two mainstream parties, New Democracy and Pasok, and forge a workable agreement with Europe and the International Monetary Fund.�I think the future of both parties lies in this merger,� said Mr. Veremis, the historian. �If they fail to pull it off, they will both go down the drain under the Syriza onslaught.�Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370: Oil slicks in South China Sea �not from missing jet�, officials sayMore than two days after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing, the final minutes before its disappearance remain a mysteryThe oil slicks found off the coast of Malaysia during the search for Flight MH370 were not caused by the missing jet, authorities have said.Laboratory analysis on the oil, which was first spotted on Saturday night, found that it had nothing to do with the Malaysia Airlines jet that disappeared almost three days ago, Malaysian officials have confirmed.Earlier the crew from a Vietnamese jet reported seeing a � possible life raft� floating in the sea around 250 miles off the country�s southern coast, only for search and rescue helicopters to later find it was no more than �a moss-covered cap of cable reel�.Speaking at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur this morning, the director-general of Malaysia's Civil Aviation body, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said officials were still struggling with an � unprecedented aviation mystery�.�Unfortunately we have not found anything that appears to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft,� he said. �As far as we are concerned, we have to find the aircraft, we have to find a piece of the aircraft if possible.�As authorities dismiss each potential clue to the whereabouts of the missing Boeing 777, attention has increasingly turned to the identities of the two passengers confirmed to be travelling on stolen European passports.This afternoon Malaysian officials said both the men had � non-Asian� features - contradicting previous suggestions otherwise from the country's interior minister.Asked to explain what he meant, Mr Rahman said they looked like the Italian footballer Mario Balotelli, but refused to elaborate further.Police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said that one has now been identified, but that he could not reveal his identity beyond confirming that he was not Malaysian.Mr Rahman also said that five passengers who checked in for the flight but who did not board, had had their luggage removed and checked. Nothing untoward was found.Almost three days after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing, the final minutes before its disappearance remain a mystery. The plane lost contact with ground controllers somewhere between Malaysia and Vietnam.Read more: Investigators focus on CCTV for cluesThere are some slightly less nefarious reasons for flying on a stolen passportSearch for missing Boeing 777 reveals two oil slicks in the Gulf of ThailandMalaysian military officials said on Sunday that the plane, a Boeing 777-200ER, may have turned back from its scheduled route shortly before vanishing from radar screens.Mr Rahman said officials had set no time-frame for the search and referred to the search for Air France flight 447 which went missing in 2009 on route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 aboard.It took investigators two years to locate the black box recorders and three years to piece together what happened. A report eventually blamed a combination of technical failure and pilot error."The experts have said this is a very big area for us to cover," Mr Rahman said of the area currently being searched. "We all have to work together to find this aircraft... It will take as long as it takes to find the aircraft."Family members comfort Chrisman Siregar (left) and his wife Herlina Panjaitan, the parents of Firman Siregar, one of the Indonesian citizens thought to have boarded the Malaysia Airlines jetliner A total of 34 aircraft and 40 ships from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, China and the United States have been deployed to the area where ground controllers lost contact with the plane, the maritime border between Malaysia and Vietnam.Of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board, two-thirds were Chinese, while the rest were from elsewhere in Asia, Europe and North America. Five Indians were among the passengers.The thefts of the two passports - one belonging to Austrian Christian Kozel and the other to Luigi Maraldi of Italy - were entered into Interpol's database after they were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and last year, the police body said.But no authorities in Malaysia or elsewhere checked the passports against the database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents before the Malaysia Airlines plane took off.Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines said it was working to provide relatives of those on board the flight visas and flights to enable them to travel to Kuala Lumpur, if they wished."Malaysia Airlines' primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families," it said in a statement. "This means providing them with timely information, travel facilities, accommodation, meals, medical and emotional support. The costs for these are all borne by Malaysia Airlines."Malaysia Airlines flight MH370: Distraught families told by text message to assume �beyond doubt no one survived�After weeks without news about the fates of their loved ones, the families of passengers on missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 have been told that it is �beyond doubt� they were killed � via an SMS message.Family members waiting for information in Kuala Lumpur were called to an emergency meeting ahead of a press conference this afternoon, and were told the latest development via a single mass text just minutes before prime minister Najib Razak informed the world.More than 150 of the 239 passengers on board the missing Boeing 777 were from China, and there were distraught scenes among relatives in Beijing as they received the news.According to BBC reports, some have such mistrust in the Malaysian authorities after 17 days of apparent misinformation that they refused to accept their relatives were indeed dead.In the text message, the airline told families �we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the Southern Indian Ocean�.It said: �Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived.�Relatives of passengers in Beijing had been called to a hotel near the airport to hear the announcement. Afterward, they filed out of a conference room in heart-wrenching grief.According to reporters with the Associated Press, men and women sobbed uncontrollably and one mother, collapsing to her knees, cried: "My son! My son!"Relatives of passengers in Beijing had been called to a hotel near the airport to hear the announcement.

My son!"Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak (C) makes an announcement on the latest development on the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane �This is a remote location far from any possible landing site.�It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform that in accordance with this new data Flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.�Jet Fell Into Ocean With All Lost, Premier SaysPEARCE AIR FORCE BASE, Australia � A British satellite company has solved one crucial aspect of the mystery surrounding the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared on March 8, using a complex mathematical process to determine that it ended its journey in the middle of the southern Indian Ocean.Guided by a principle of physics called the Doppler effect, the company, Inmarsat, analyzed tiny shifts in the frequency of the plane�s signals to infer the plane�s flight path and likely final location. The method had never before been used to investigate an air disaster, officials said.The first definitive news of the fate of the Boeing 777 jet brought heartbreak to the families of those on board as Malaysia�s prime minister, Najib Razak, announced on Monday that no one is believed to have survived the flight.�This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites,� a somber Mr. Najib said. �It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, Flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.�Mr. Najib appeared eager to bring some finality to the families of the passengers, who had complained for more than two weeks about the incomplete and sometimes contradictory information they were getting. Two-thirds of the plane�s passengers were Chinese citizens, and the flight was bound for Beijing when it took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, after midnight on March 8.But many furious Chinese relatives and friends of passengers refused to believe it, wailing with anguish and screaming that the Malaysians were lying and hiding what they knew.�The Malaysian government is not telling the truth,� said one woman among the relatives of passengers who gathered at the Lido Hotel in Beijing to wait for news of the flight. �All governments are corrupt. The Malaysian government is hiding something.�The announcement did little to solve the deeper mystery of the plane�s disappearance, shedding no light on why someone with detailed knowledge of the plane�s navigation and flight systems diverted it radically from its course. Investigators said they have looked into the backgrounds of the 239 people on board, including the two pilots and the crew, and have so far found no answers to that central question.However long expected, the news that the jet was lost came as a body blow, dashing the hopes that many had clung to with increasing desperation that somehow the plane had been hijacked and taken to some obscure spot where the passengers could still be alive.A few people in the hotel ballroom in Beijing collapsed and were put on wheeled stretchers and taken to the parking lot, which was full of police cars and ambulances. Inside the hotel, police officers in navy-blue uniforms stood guard every few feet and blocked scores of jostling journalists from entering the ballroom. Several women emerged sobbing so hard that knots of friends and family had to help them walk to the elevators.�We demand the truth,� said a young woman in a red ski jacket. �The Chinese government should step up and find out the truth for us. Nobody cares about us. Nobody cares about the lives of our family.�Continue reading the main storyLi Chengpeng, a popular Chinese social critic, gave voice to the deep skepticism held by many Chinese of the official announcement. He posted a message for the seven million followers of his microblog, calling Mr. Najib�s news conference staged theater. �Just now, they were not actually publicizing the truth but were merely giving a show of publicizing the truth,� he wrote. �It looks like there are traces of rehearsal. Politicians are shameless! Keep investigating!�Where Objects Have Been SpottedIn the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.5,000 FT.Possible flight pathsAUSTRALIAINDIAN OCEANWATER DEPTH10,000 FT.Perth10,000 FT.Areas previouslysearchedAlbany15,000 FT.10,000 FT.OBJECTS SPOTTEDMarch 16 (satellite image)122 objects spottedby a satellite on March 23March 18 (satellite image)March 24 (by a Chinese plane)More mapsDebrisTrackingSorting Outthe CluesReconstructingthe PathThe Malaysian prime minister based his announcement on a new analysis of satellite signal data that ruled out any chance that the plane had flown north, toward land, from its last known position on March 8. It had to have flown south, the analysis found, and by the time of the last recorded signal, it would have been nearly out of fuel over a rough, deep ocean, more than a thousand miles from anywhere it could have landed safely.The search focused more tightly on that area on Monday after an Australian military search plane spotted several floating objects that could be debris from the plane, and ships raced to investigate. On Tuesday, officials said, search flights were called off because of bad weather.One of the assumptions in the analysis was that for the final few hours of the plane�s flight at least, it was cruising at a fairly constant speed and direction, suggesting that it was being flown by the autopilot system. Experts said that was certainly possible.A former Boeing instructor pilot, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said, � �Heading select mode� is dumb,� referring to one way the plane�s autopilot could be set. �It doesn�t know anything except, �maintain this heading.� �The instructor, who has trained Boeing pilots at airlines around the world, said that in that mode, the plane would probably fly on steadily until one engine�s fuel supply was exhausted, but that after that, the plane would probably soon become destabilized and crash without a skilled human pilot at the controls.The plane took off with ample fuel to fly to Beijing, more than 2,500 miles from Kuala Lumpur, with a margin of safety. Based on that, Malaysian officials have estimated that it could have stayed in the air until about a half-hour after the last satellite signal was recorded.The floating objects were spotted on Monday about 1,500 miles southwest of Perth, Australia, by the crew of a P-3 Orion surveillance plane from the Royal Australian Air Force. An Australian naval survey ship, the Success, was directed to try to find and recover the objects, the Australian authorities said. A Chinese military aircraft also reported a possible sighting of floating objects in the search area, but that sighting was at a different location and was much more tentative.The search for the aircraft�s fuselage, and other bulky parts of the jet that probably sank to the bottom of the ocean, is likely to be focused within a limited distance from the suspected flight path. But the search for floating debris is likely to be widespread.Continue reading the main storyTracking Flight 370The sequence of events known by the authorities, in local times.Mar. 8, 2014 12:41 a.m.A Boeing 777-200 operated by Malaysia Airlines leaves Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing with 227 passengers, of which two-thirds are Chinese, and a Malaysian crew of 12.By ByContinue reading the main storyErik van Sebille, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales who studies and has conducted experiments on the flow of water around Australia, said the conditions of the southern Indian Ocean are �extremely hostile,� with large waves, swirling currents and winds that are among the strongest on the planet. Currents in the southern Indian Ocean could scatter debris, he said.�The whole ocean down there is like a pinball machine,� Dr. van Sebille said. �It is difficult to track or predict where water goes, or do what is really important now, which is to backtrack where water came from.�Finding the plane�s flight recorders, or black boxes, will be crucial to determining what may have caused the plane�s disappearance. The devices are designed to transmit signals to help searchers locate them, but searchers have only about two weeks left to find them before the devices� batteries run out.The United States Pacific Command said Monday that it would move a Towed Pinger Locator System, capable of locating a black box to a depth of 20,000 feet, into the region.On Tuesday morning, relatives and friends of many of the 153 Chinese passengers gathered again at the Lido, some carrying protest banners. Their aim was to take buses to the Malaysian Embassy and demand answers. But before noon, police officers told the protesters that the Malaysian ambassador would come to the Lido to talk to them and urged them not to go to the embassy, according to people on the scene.Flight MH370 'crashed in south Indian Ocean' - Malaysia PMMalaysia's prime minister has announced that missing flight MH370 crashed in the southern Indian Ocean.Najib Razak said this was the conclusion of fresh analysis of satellite data tracking the flight.Malaysia Airlines had told the families of the 239 people on board, he said.The BBC has seen a text message sent to families by the airline saying it had to be assumed "beyond reasonable doubt" that the plane was lost and there were no survivors.There were 227 passengers on flight MH370, many of them Chinese.Relatives of those on board who watched the announcement at a Beijing hotel wept with grief, and some were taken away on stretchers by medical teams.China has demanded that the Malaysian authorities make available the evidence on which they based their announcement about the jet's fate.And some relatives of Chinese passengers expressed scepticism about their conclusion, as the plane has not been found yet.Flight MH370 disappeared after taking off on 8 March from Kuala Lumpur.A big international search operation has been taking place in the southern Indian Ocean, along the southern arc or corridor of the plane's possible route, more than 1,500 miles (2,500km) off the south-west coast of Australia.However, the search had to be suspended on Tuesday due to bad weather, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said.In the past day, both Australian and Chinese air force crews have reported spotting debris.The unidentified objects have been seen in separate parts of the vast search area, in some of the world's most treacherous and remote waters.HeartbreakingThe announcement by Prime Minister Najib Razak came at a late-night news conference in Kuala Lumpur.It was based on new analysis by British satellite firm Inmarsat, which provided satellite data, and the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB).The firms "have concluded that MH370 flew along the southern corridor, and that its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth," Mr Najib said."This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean."Mr Najib appealed to the media to respect the privacy of the families of the passengers and crew, saying the wait for information had been heartbreaking and this latest news harder still.Malaysia Airlines later said it informed the majority of the families in advance of the prime minister's statement in person and by telephone, and that text messages "were used only as an additional means of communicating with the families".The text messages read: "Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived... we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the Southern Indian Ocean."Selamat Omar, the father of a 29-year-old aviation engineer who was on the flight, said some family members of other passengers broke down in tears at the news."We accept the news of the tragedy. It is fate," Selamat told the Associated Press in Kuala Lumpur.Fresh analysis methodsInmarsat had already revealed that it did indeed receive signals - automated "pings" - from the plane over its satellite network after the aircraft ceased radio and radar contact.Sources told the BBC that flight MH370 continued to ping for at least five hours after the aircraft left Malaysian airspace - which indicated the plane was intact and powered.And initial analysis showed the location of the final "ping" was probably along one of two vast arcs running north and south.On Monday, the Malaysian prime minister said Inmarsat had been able to shed further light on the plane's flight path by performing further calculations on the MH370 data "using a type of analysis never before used in an investigation of this sort".According to Inmarsat, this involved a totally new way of modelling, which was why it took time.The company told the BBC the new calculation involved crunching far more data and that engineers spent all weekend looking back at previous Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 flights.They compared the satellite data from those flights with flight MH370 and were able to work out that it went south.As far as the engineers could tell, the plane was flying at a cruising height above 30,000ft, but its final position could not be pinpointed more clearly, says BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott.Inmarsat gave the AAIB the new data on Sunday, it said, which had to be checked before it could be made public.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370: 'Mystery compounded by mystery'Few details on fate of Boeing 777-200 jet travelling from Kuala Lumpur to BeijingThree days after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared off radar, the plane�s demise is one shrouded in mystery and conjecture.There are scant details about what happened to the Boeing 777-200 plane travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board.�We�re looking at mystery compounded by mystery compounded by mystery,� Chris Yates, who runs a U.K. aviation security consultancy company, told CBC's The Current.Here are some key questions that remain unanswered.Where's the plane?Radio contact with the flight was lost about an hour after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur, which was at 12:21 a.m. on Saturday, March 8. The last contact with air traffic controllers was 120 nautical miles off the east coast of Malaysia, near the northern town of Kota Bharu, located near the Thai border.About 40 ships and 34 aircraft from 10 countries, including Australia, Vietnam, China and the U.S., are searching the seas off Malaysia and Vietnam for the plane. The search area covers a 50-nautical-mile radius but is reportedly being widened to a 100-nautical-mile radius from its last known position. That widens it from an area half the size of Nova Scotia to double the size of the province.The search area covers waters east of Malaysia � the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea � but also the Strait of Malacca to the west.Oil slicks and debris initially spotted during the search turned out not to be associated with the flight. Though black boxes can emit radio beacons for radars to pick up, no signals have been detected in the wide search area.Yates said that it�s �extremely unusual� for a plane to crash without a trace for so many days. In the last such accident, Air France Flight 447, it took about five days to locate the first debris after the plane plunged into the Atlantic Ocean during stormy weather. It took two more years to figure out what actually happened.Why was there no distress signal?Air traffic controllers say no distress signal was issued. Several aviation experts say that is not unusual.In an interview with CBS News, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger, who famously piloted a plane to a safe landing on the Hudson River in New York, noted that pilots are often too busy during a crisis situation to communicate with air controllers. The top priority for pilots is to get the plane under control, and signalling to controllers does little to help them do so."The pressure of trying to find out what's going on can keep a crew busy when they're unable to communicate," said Sullenberger.Andy Kovacs, a Seneca College flight instructor and Air Canada pilot, notes that it is also possible that the aircraft was in a remote location and the crew had difficulty raising air traffic control on the VHF or HF radio. A distress call could've been made but not received."If the crew was unable to send a distress call, the event most likely happened very quickly," said Kovacs to CBC News.Did the plane turn around � and why?Malaysian military officials say that radar data suggests that the plane might have turned back toward Kuala Lumpur before vanishing. But there�s no indication why they would do so, because no contact was made with air traffic controllers.Some experts note that it may not be the result of the crew changing the flight direction. In Air France 447�s descent, the plane also changed its direction by more than 180 degrees, but only as an unintentional side effect, according to Bill Palmer, an Airbus 330 captain and author of Understanding Air France 447.What about the passengers?Of the 239 people on board the flight, two were Canadian. The majority of the passengers were from China or Taiwan (154) or from Malaysia (38). Others came from India, Australia, France, the United States, Ukraine, Russia and the Netherlands.Of most interest, however, are the two passengers who boarded with passports stolen from Austrian and Italian citizens. These citizens both reported the documents as stolen in Thailand in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and both were listed in Interpol�s database of suspect passports.Interpol said it is �too soon to speculate� about connections between the stolen passports and the missing flight, but the incident raised questions about the fact that few countries systematically search Interpol's database containing entries on 40 million stolen passports."We have a real case where the world is speculating whether the stolen passport holders were terrorists, while Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights," said Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble.Interpol is checking whether any other passengers used stolen passports.Could the missing plane be linked to terrorism?The head of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahmanthe, called the incident an "unprecedented aviation mystery" and said hijacking could not be ruled out. A police official told Reuters they'd stopped people armed with explosives and carrying fake identity papers from flying out of Kuala Lumpur three times in the past.However, U.S. government sources who reviewed spy satellite imagery said there were no signs of a mid-air explosion.Taiwanese authorities revealed Monday that they'd received information about a possible terrorist attack on Beijing's airport four days prior to the departure of the missing flight. "Anything is possible," said Jean Shen, the head of the Taiwanese Civil Aeronautics Administration, but added the two incidents appear to be unrelated and cautioned against jumping to conclusions.The United States has deployed FBI agents and technical experts to help investigate whether there are any connections to terrorism, but at this time are stressing there is no indication of such ties.No organizations have claimed responsibility for the attack. And as Yates notes, the use of stolen passports could simply be a case of illegal migration.What's next?It will take a long time before investigators can piece together what happened to the Malaysia Airlines flight. But perhaps not as long as the Air France investigation, which was hindered because the wreckage was submerged deep in the Atlantic Ocean. There, the plane lay several miles underwater. The Gulf of Thailand, by comparison, reaches up to 260 feet in depth.Airplane black boxes emit a signal that helps search and rescue crews locate the plane, but the signal cuts out after 30 days.Michelle Obama Derided For Being A �Feminist Nightmare�Politico Magazine�s cover story declares Michelle Obama �a feminist nightmare,� a label no doubt intended to stir up controversy in feminist circles. Politico�s premise is that Michelle Obama, despite her high-powered corporate law background, has �leaned out� by failing to engage on policy. Instead, writer Michelle Cottle scoffs, �the Ivy-educated, blue-chip law firm-trained first lady� has embraced �safely, soothingly domestic causes� like �gardening� and �clean drinking water.�This dismissal of Mrs. Obama�s �gardening� ignores the fact that the First Lady is virtually the only person in the Obama administration to address one of the biggest public health crises to ever face the U.S. The American obesity epidemic threatens long-lasting implications for future inequality, mobility, labor, and economic productivity.Obama�s signature campaign, �Let�s Move,� has hardly been as combative as it could be, yet it is responsible for some of the most meaningful federal action on childhood obesity in years. Obama was instrumental in enacting child nutrition reforms in 2010, giving the U.S. Department of Agriculture the power to set nutritional standards for food sold in schools and increased funding for nutritious meals for low-income children. That initiative has also proven deeply controversial, as many conservatives complain that standards are too tough and that kids won�t eat healthier food.So why is this wide-reaching policy initiative so cavalierly written off as a �soothingly domestic cause�?The Politico screed follows a cultural arithmetic that devalues certain kinds of labor as �women�s work.� Traditionally, domestic and child-related fields like teaching, cooking, housekeeping, childcare, nursing, and, yes, gardening, are considered women�s work. Studies show this label does not merely hurt prestige; female-dominated professions are consistently paid less than male-dominated jobs like manufacturing, engineering or financial services. These biases have nothing to do with the actual value of the labor. For instance, one of the most well-paid and male-dominated field today, computer programming, was mocked as women�s work for decades, until male programmers made a conscious choice to increase the prestige of their field by squeezing women out of jobs.Under our macho metric of success, Obama�s past work as a hospital executive and board member for a food corporation is approvingly termed �high-powered,� but continuing to work on public health issues through national outreach and child advocacy is a descent into the realm of complacent wives and moms. Indeed, Obama often endures mocking in the press as a typical mom nagging kids to eat their vegetables, even as she advances nutrition policies for millions of children.Cottle wishes, without going into much detail, that Obama would speak out on �a variety of tough issues� and perhaps �focus a spotlight on the myriad problems eating away at minority communities.� Of course, childhood obesity and access to healthy food are crises almost entirely confined to impoverished minority communities. Nearly 40 percent of black and Latino children are obese, compared to 27 percent of their white peers. Poor children of any race are nearly twice as likely to be obese, and rarely have access to the nutrients they need.The vast majority of children who have benefited from Obama�s school lunch reform are black, Latino, and Native American. These students rely on subsidized or free school meals, which are sometimes the only food a child will eat that day. Food insecurity also takes a toll on students� academic performance, but research shows school lunch programs can actually reverse that damage.Obama has also faced daunting opponents in her crusade; Big Food has circumvented her efforts at every opportunity. Obama has become somewhat more aggressive in calling out junk food companies for marketing their products to children of color. In the past, she�s demanded that processed food corporations like Kraft and General Mills �entirely rethink� their products �so that they have less fat, salt, and sugar, and more of the nutrients that our kids need.� She�s also pressured Walmart into publicly agreeing to stock more organic and locally-sourced foods and open more stores in food deserts (a corporate partnership that has yielded a mixed bag).After five years of Obama�s advocacy, childhood obesity rates are beginning to drop for the first time ever. The First Lady may not be able to take full credit for this monumental change, but her highly visible campaigns have at the very least helped spark serious conversation about the obesity epidemic. But to reduce the only serious federal attempt to curb obesity to the trivial distractions of a �mom-in-chief� is to tell millions of poor women and children their plight is not worth fighting for.First lady Michelle to visit China with daughtersChina National News Wednesday 5th March, 2014first lady michelle to visit china with daughters� Michelle will be on a weeklong education trip to China� She will be talking with students about their lives in China� It's not the first time the First lady will be on solo diplomatic tripWASHINGTON - First lady Michelle Obama is travelling to China later this month on an education themed trip along with her daughters Malia and Sasha and her mother Marian Robinson, the White House has announced.During the March 19-26 trip, Michelle is also likely to meet with her Chinese counterpart, Peng Liyuan, who is a popular folk singer and the second wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping.The trip is seen as an attempt to make up for what was seen in China as a slight last year when President Barack Obama met with Xi in California but the First lady did not make the trip, though Peng did.Michelle in a blog post on the White House website said she planned to visit a university and two high schools in Beijing and Chengdu, and will "be talking with students about their lives in China and telling them about America and the values and traditions we hold dear"."I'll be focusing in particular on the power and importance of education, both in my own life and in the lives of young people in both of our countries."She said she would also travel to historic and cultural sites and will share "the stories of the students I meet, as well as the interesting facts I learn about Chinese history and culture" via a daily travel blog and posts on Twitter and Instagram.In a message to students, she said: "These issues affect every last one of us, so it's critically important that young people like you learn about what's going on not just here in America, but around the world."It's not the first time the First lady has set out on solo diplomatic visits.In 2010 she assessed earthquake damage in Haiti. She then travelled to Mexico for meetings on getting youths engaged in important political and economic questions.In 2011 she traveled to Botswana and South Africa sans spouse.Eleanor Roosevelt pioneered such trips, as she did with so many other aspects of the modern role of First lady.Roosevelt was the first presidential wife to travel overseas on her own. As a representative of the Red Cross, she traveled to England and Ireland and US bases throughout the Pacific in World War II.The Kennedy administration deployed First lady Jacqueline Kennedy to unique effect. Admired throughout the world, she built goodwill for the US in solo trips to Greece and Italy. In 1962 she was officially designated a "goodwill ambassador" for a trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan.More recently, Laura Bush traveled to the Middle East as First lady to promote breast cancer awareness.Hillary Clinton made a solo trip to China in 1995 to attend a UN Conference on Women, where she called on the host nation to do more to push progress in gender equality.Bring Back Our Girls: Michelle Obama and Malala Yousafzai support campaign for return of kidnapped Nigeria schoolgirlsMichelle Obama and Malala Yousafzai have become the latest high-profile figures to join worldwide calls for the return of almost 300 schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria.The leader of Boko Haram, an Islamic militant group trying to overthrow the government, threatened to �sell� the girls at a market.The latest horror inflicted by the rebels, who target educational institutions as part of their campaign against anything perceived to be �Western�, triggered a viral social media campaign across the world.Mrs Obama tweeted:  �Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls.�The tweet included a picture of her in the White House holding a placard displaying the hashtag.Malala, who became a leading global advocate for girls� education after surviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban, is pictured holding a #BringBackOurGirls sign in the Twitter profile picture of her organisation.Angelina Jolie, Hilary Clinton, and Amy Poehler are among those lending their support to the campaign.More than 200 children were taken from school in the town of Chibok last month and eight more from another village on Monday.None of the girls have been found and the Nigerian government�s perceived failure to rescue them has sparked angry protests.The US, Britain, France and China have sent experts to help the search.Boko Haram's uprising has claimed the lives of thousands of Muslims and Christians, including more than 1,500 people killed in attacks so far this year.The group, whose name roughly translates as �Western education is forbidden�, has targeted schools as well as churches, mosques, government buildings and security forces.Their bloody campaign has highlighted the stark divide between  Nigeria�s wealthier and predominantly Christian south and Muslim north.Michelle Obama Goes Organic and Brings in the BeesGoing organic in the White House was easy. Both Bubba's and W's kitchens did that with purchases from local farms and a nearby organic market. But homegrown fare, like what first lady Michelle Obama hopes to produce with her new spring vegetable garden on the South Lawn�now, that's more complicated. And not just because crops have to be planted and tended. Washington isn't really known for its population of honeybees, the buzzy bugs needed for pollination. So�you guessed it�the first-ever White House beehive has been installed.Charlie Brandts, a White House carpenter for 25 years, is now the First Beekeeper. He got the ball rolling when he told some of the East Wing staff about his hobby. "I was thinking about how cool it would be to bring bees to the White House," Brandts says. Word made it to chef Sam Kass, who asked Brandts if he could make White House honey to use in Obama family recipes. On Tuesday, Brandts brought in one of his hives and put it near the garden.While he's been in beekeeping for only three years, Brandts sounds like a longtime pro. "I'm trying to promote beekeeping," he tells Whispers. He started raising bees for the same reason the first lady dug her garden: "I wanted to eat healthier," he says. That meant shifting from sugar to honey. "But it kind of gets expensive," he says, "and I thought it can't be too hard to put together a few hives in my yard" in nearby Fairland, Md.While the hive has been welcomed by the first family, Brandts concedes that some workers had to be convinced that honeybees are largely harmless. (Ironically, it was some of the security staff who worried about getting stung.) As with many people with access to hives, the first family might get hooked on bees, and Brandts hopes to bring more hives in. "And if they don't like them, we can always take them out."Michelle Obama's Book On Growing Seeds and Healthy KidsFrom the beginning, Michelle Obama's kitchen garden has been an overachiever, churning out more peppers, parsley and eggplant than expected, and generating interest that � yes, really � crosses oceans.Now, the first lady has added a 271-page book to her gardening resum�, and Americans can read all about the planting misses that came with the hits, get tips on gardening at home, and, Obama hopes, draw some inspiration that just might change their lives. Oh, and if it happens to help her husband's re-election campaign, that would be nice, too.Lofty goals for a book about a garden.In "American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America," Obama holds out the raised vegetable beds on the South Lawn as "an expression of my hopes" for the nation's children. "Just as each seed we plant has the potential to become something extraordinary, so does every child," she writes.The $30 book, released Tuesday by Crown Publishers, traces how a city kid from the South Side of Chicago who became a working mother and then a political spouse found herself fretting on that first planting day, March 20, 2009, about whether an L-shaped stretch of soil would prove fertile ground for a national conversation "about the food we eat, the lives we lead, and how all of that affects our children."The book, which answers that question with a resounding yes, arrives just in time for her husband's re-election campaign.And while the book is decidedly non-political, that fits perfectly with the Obama campaign's view that the first lady can do her husband a world of good simply by pushing the non-threatening causes such as healthy living that have made her a far more popular figure than the president himself. Mrs. Obama's favorability rating in the latest AP-GfK poll was 70 percent, compared with 58 percent for her husband.The book's release comes with a flurry of media appearances. She's already been a TV frequent flyer to promote her "Let's Move" campaign to combat childhood obesity � doing pushups with Ellen DeGeneres, playing tug-of-war with Jimmy Fallon in the White House and serving veggie pizza to Jay Leno. She says she gets asked about the garden wherever she goes, around the world.The book is chock full of colorful, glossy photos of luscious-looking vegetables, complete with a cover picture in which the first lady's blouse seems to be color-coordinated with the eggplants in her bulging basket of produce. Bo, the popular family dog, gets plenty of cameo appearances. There are maps tracing the growth of the garden over the past three years, and stories about community gardens around the country. Even a how-to on creating a compost bin.The book is divided into four sections marking the seasons, and includes a complement of recipes for each.There are inside stories about planting travails that will ring true with any weekend gardener: pumpkins that wouldn't grow, cantaloupes that tasted blah, blackberry bushes that wouldn't play nice with the raspberry bushes and an invasion of cucumber beetles, among them. The first lady makes clear she's not the one doing most of the hoeing and weeding, crediting school kids, White House chefs and grounds crew and enthusiastic volunteers from all over the White House chain of command with providing lots of manpower.And there are bits of historical trivia woven throughout: John Adams ordered up the first White House garden, but it was never harvested after he lost re-election. Thomas Jefferson was obsessed with trying to grow a four-foot-long cucumber. Heiress Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, at 101 now a figure in the John Edwards' corruption trial, helped redesign the Rose Garden for President John Kennedy.There are also bits of personal history: Mrs. Obama's father worked as a boy on one of the vegetable trucks that would deliver produce to neighborhoods, and had a reputation for sneaking pieces of fruit. Her mother's family had a plot in a neighborhood victory garden on the corner of an alley, and the kids had to eat their vegetables or go to bed without supper.It is a tradition for first ladies to use books to advance their causes. Hillary Clinton wrote the best-seller "It Takes a Village," about the importance of community in raising children; and Laura Bush collaborated with daughter Jenna on a picture book about a reluctant reader, with "Read All About It!"This is Michelle Obama's first book. She got no advance payment, and plans to donate all her proceeds to the National Park Foundation for programs that promote gardening and healthy eating, and to help care for the White House garden.Michelle Obama speaks to gay DemocratsNEW YORK � Michelle Obama won a standing ovation on Thursday when she paid a campaign visit to gay and lesbian Democratic activists to promote her husband Barack Obama�s presidential quest.Obama, appearing at a dinner meeting of the Gay & Lesbian Leadership Council of the Democratic National Committee, cited her husband�s efforts to fight discrimination and promote equal rights for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgendered people.She said he supported a complete repeal of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which only recognizes marriages between men and women and upholds states� rights not to honor same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. He also opposes a �don�t ask, don�t tell� policy toward gays in the U.S. military and was against a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, she added.He supports full family and adoption rights for gay and lesbian couples and believes the federal government should not stand in the way of states that opt for domestic partnerships, civil unions or civil marriage, she said. The Illinois senator opposes same-sex marriage.�Barack believes that we must fight for the world as it should be, a world where together we work to reverse discriminatory laws like DOMA and �don�t ask, don�t tell,�� she said. �The world as it is should be one that rejects discrimination of all kinds.�Her husband also has called for a renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS and has said the African-American community should overcome homophobia, she said.�Nothing we have to do over the next four or eight years is going to be easy. There will be powerful forces who believe that things should stay just as they are, that everything is fine, and that�s where you all come in,� she said.�Your voices of truth and hope and of possibility have got to drown out the skeptics and the cynics,� she said.Michelle Obama Speaks to LGBT Delegates at Convention LunchBefore heading over to the Pepsi Center on Tuesday we stopped by the luncheon for LGBT Delegates Hosted by Rep. Barney Frank, with Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and Human Rights Campaign.But the big event of the luncheon was an unscheduled appearance by Michelle Obama. I got a nice surprise when, after her speech, she stepped down and walked over to some of us and I was able to shake the hand of this impressive woman.I also finally had a chance to meet Pam Spaulding of the excellent blog Pam's House Blend on Monday of the Convention. Pam has a brief clip of the crowd going nuts over Michelle Obama's introduction.You can listen to a longer clip of Michelle Obama's remarks to the LGBT delegation, AFTER THE JUMP...Michelle Obama Welcomes Gay Families to National Military InitiativeFirst Lady Michelle Obama �looks forward to including� openly gay service members in her national military families initiative with the �don�t ask, don�t tell� policy set to expire in less than 24 hours.The campaign, Joining Forces, is a multi-prong national program launched in April by the First Lady and Dr. Jill Biden to support military families through public service outreach and partnerships with some of the nation�s largest corporations, among other efforts.�The First Lady and Dr. Biden will continue to recognize and honor the families of all service members, as they have been doing since the beginning of Joining Forces,� Kristina Schake, Mrs. Obama's communications director, said in a statement to The Advocate.�After the repeal of Don�t Ask, Don�t Tell takes effect, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Biden look forward to including openly gay and lesbian service members in events to recognize their service to the nation, as well as the service of their families,� Schake said.The statement is similar to one made just prior to the White House launch event for Joining Forces in April. At that time, the White House had cited that DADT remained in effect and precluded participation by gay service members or their representative advocacy groups at the East Room unveiling of the initiative.That decision drew criticism from some gay service member advocacy groups who said that inclusion would have been a symbolic opportunity to recognize families of gay troops � families who likely would not have been able to participate in on-base Joining Forces events prior to DADT repeal. �At the moment, I can�t even buy a stamp on base,� one partner of a gay service member said in April. �That�s pretty sad. Our primary interest is just being treated the same as other military families. We�re not looking for anything novel beyond that.�As well as a general awareness campaign focused on the challenges that military families face, Joining Forces works with private employers such as Wal-Mart to secure military spouse job transfers resulting from new duty assignments. It also promotes greater inclusion of military families in entertainment programming via partnerships with Hollywood guilds including the Writers Guild of America and Directors Guild of America.�[T]he truth is that as a country, we don�t always see their families, our heroes on the home front,� Mrs. Obama said at the April launch event. �These families have appealed to us, like a military mom who wrote to me and said, �Please don�t let Americans forget or ignore what we live with.��In January, the administration called on government agencies to better address issues in employment, housing, and education affecting the nation�s 2.2 million service members and their families.Jarrett, Michelle Obama pushed for gay marriagePresident Obama mentioned that he and his wife share the position he announced in support of gay marriage, and Thrush and Budoff Brown dig deeper into who helped him arrive where he did:Senior White House officials, speaking to a small group of reporters at a Wednesday background briefing, denied reports that two of Obama�s top political advisers, David Plouffe and David Axelrod, urged Obama to slow-walk the decision for fear of a backlash.They say the internal debate ended about three months ago when the president told them he supported gay marriage after weighing the personal, religious and political considerations.But there were clearly some in Obama�s inner circle who were more enthusiastic about the decision than others, according to advocates and top Democrats.Two of the most consistent advocates for marriage equality were two of the most important women in Obama�s life: his wife Michelle and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett, who has repeatedly told her friends in the LGBT community that Obama was moving in their direction, according to people familiar with those interactions.Michelle ObamaMichelle LaVaughn Robinson ObamaIn the News: First lady Michelle Obama revealed on Wednesday (February 25, 2009) that the family plans to get a dog after their spring break trip this April. Barack and Michelle Obama promised their daughters a dog after the election.Obama says her daughters have already been going back and forth on possible names. "Oh, the names are really bad," she said. "I don't even want to mention it...Frank was one of them. Frank! Moose was another one of them. Moose. I'm like, no, come on, let's work with the names a little bit."The Obamas don't have a particular dog in mind yet, but the first lady revealed that the family wants to rescue a Portuguese water dog. "Temperamentally, they're supposed to be pretty good," the first lady said. "From the size perspective, they're sort of middle of the road�it's not small, but it's not a huge dog. And the folks that we know who own them have raved about them. So that's where we're leaning."Biography: Lawyer, Chicago city administrator, community outreach worker and wife of President Barack Obama. Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama was born January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois.Michelle was raised on Chicago's South Side in a one-bedroom apartment. Her father, Frasier Robinson, was a city pump operator and a Democratic precinct captain. Her mother, Marian, was a Spiegel's secretary who later stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother, Craig. The family has been described as a close-knit one that shared family meals, read and played games together.Craig and Michelle, 16 months apart in age, were often mistaken for twins. The siblings also shared close quarters; they slept in the living room with a makeshift sheet serving as their room divider. Both children were raised with an emphasis on education. The brother and sister learned to read at home by the age of four, and both skipped second grade.By sixth grade, Michelle was attending gifted classes, where she learned French and took accelerated courses. She then went on to attend the city's first magnet high school for gifted children where, among other activities, she served as the student government treasurer. "Without being immodest, we were always smart, we were always driven and we were always encouraged to do the best you can do, not just what's necessary," her brother Craig, has said. "And when it came to going to schools, we all wanted to go to the best schools we could."Michelle graduated in 1981 from Whitney M. Young Magnet High School in Chicago's West Loop as class salutatorian. After high school, she followed her brother to Princeton University, graduating cum laude in 1985 with a B.A. in Sociology. She went on to earn a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1988, where she took part in demonstrations demanding more minority students and professors.Following law school, Michelle worked as an associate in the Chicago branch of the law firm Sidley Austin in the area of marketing and intellectual property. There in 1989, she met her future husband, Barack Obama, a summer intern to whom she was assigned as an adviser. "I went to Harvard and he went to Harvard, and the firm thought, 'Oh, we'll hook these two people up,'" Michelle said. "So, you know, there was a little intrigue, but I must say after about a month, Barack...asked me out, and I thought no way. This is completely tacky." Initially, she refused to date Obama, believing that their work relationship would make the romance improper. Eventually she relented, and the couple soon fell in love.After two years of dating, Barack proposed. "We were at a restaurant having dinner to celebrate the fact that he had finished the bar," Michelle remembers. "Then the waiter came over with the dessert and a tray. And there was the ring. And I was completely shocked." The couple married at Trinity United Church of Christ on October 18, 1992.Michelle soon left her job to launch a career in public service, serving as an assistant to Mayor Daley and then as the assistant commissioner of planning and development for the City of Chicago.In 1993, she became Executive Director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit leadership-training program that helped young adults develop skills for future careers in the public sector.Michelle joined the University of Chicago in 1996 as associate dean of student services, developing the University's first community service program. She then worked for the University of Chicago Hospitals beginning in 2002, as executive director of community relations and external affairs.In May 2005, she was appointed vice president of community relations and external affairs at the University of Chicago Medical Center, where she continues to work part-time. She also manages the business diversity program and sits on six boards, including the prestigious Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools.Michelle Obama first caught the eye of a national audience at her husband's side when he delivered a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. Barack Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate from Illinois that November.In 2007, she scaled back her own professional work to attend to family and campaign obligations during Barack's run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Michelle says she's made a "commitment to be away overnight only once a week � to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day" for their two daughters, Malia (born 1999) and Natasha (2001). It has been reported that the Obama family has no nanny, and that the children are left with their grandmother, Marian, while their parents campaign. "I've never participated at this level in any of his campaigns," Michelle says. "I have usually chosen to just appear when necessary."Since her husband's political role pushed the Obama family into the spotlight, Michelle has been publicly recognized for her steely, no-nonsense campaign style as well as her sense of fashion. In May of 2006, Michelle was featured in Essence magazine as one of "25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women." Then in September 2007, Michelle was listed in 02138 magazine as number 58 in "The Harvard 100," a list of the most influential alumni for the year. She has also made the Vanity Fair best-dressed list two years in a row, as well as People Magazine's 2008 best-dressed list.Michelle Obama became the 44th First Lady of the United States on January 20, 2009.In First Lady�s Roots, a Complex Path From SlaveryWASHINGTON � In 1850, the elderly master of a South Carolina estate took pen in hand and painstakingly divided up his possessions. Among the spinning wheels, scythes, tablecloths and cattle that he bequeathed to his far-flung heirs was a 6-year-old slave girl valued soon afterward at $475.In his will, she is described simply as the �negro girl Melvinia.� After his death, she was torn away from the people and places she knew and shipped to Georgia. While she was still a teenager, a white man would father her first-born son under circumstances lost in the passage of time.In the annals of American slavery, this painful story would be utterly unremarkable, save for one reason: This union, consummated some two years before the Civil War, represents the origins of a family line that would extend from rural Georgia, to Birmingham, Ala., to Chicago and, finally, to the White House.Melvinia Shields, the enslaved and illiterate young girl, and the unknown white man who impregnated her are the great-great-great-grandparents of Michelle Obama, the first lady.Viewed by many as a powerful symbol of black advancement, Mrs. Obama grew up with only a vague sense of her ancestry, aides and relatives said. During the presidential campaign, the family learned about one paternal great-great-grandfather, a former slave from South Carolina, but the rest of Mrs. Obama�s roots were a mystery.Now the more complete map of Mrs. Obama�s ancestors � including the slave mother, white father and their biracial son, Dolphus T. Shields � for the first time fully connects the first African-American first lady to the history of slavery, tracing their five-generation journey from bondage to a front-row seat to the presidency.The findings � uncovered by Megan Smolenyak, a genealogist, and The New York Times � substantiate what Mrs. Obama has called longstanding family rumors about a white forebear.While President Obama�s biracial background has drawn considerable attention, his wife�s pedigree, which includes American Indian strands, highlights the complicated history of racial intermingling, sometimes born of violence or coercion, that lingers in the bloodlines of many African-Americans. Mrs. Obama and her family declined to comment for this article, aides said, in part because of the personal nature of the subject.�She is representative of how we have evolved and who we are,� said Edward Ball, a historian who discovered that he had black relatives, the descendants of his white slave-owning ancestors, when he researched his memoir, �Slaves in the Family.��We are not separate tribes of Latinos and whites and blacks in America,� Mr. Ball said. �We�ve all mingled, and we have done so for generations.�The outlines of Mrs. Obama�s family history unfolded from 19th century probate records, yellowing marriage licenses, fading photographs and the recollections of elderly women who remember the family. Ms. Smolenyak, who has traced the ancestry of many prominent figures, began studying the first lady�s roots in earnest after conducting some preliminary research into Mrs. Obama�s ancestry for an article published in The New York Times earlier this year.Of the dozens of relatives she identified, Ms. Smolenyak said, it was the slave girl who seemed to call out most clearly.�Out of all Michelle�s roots, it�s Melvinia who is screaming to be found,� she said.When her owner, David Patterson, died in 1852, Melvinia soon found herself on a 200-acre farm with new masters, Mr. Patterson�s daughter and son-in law, Christianne and Henry Shields. It was a strange and unfamiliar world.In South Carolina, she had lived on an estate with 21 slaves. In Georgia, she was one of only three slaves on property that is now part of a neat subdivision in Rex, near Atlanta.Whether Melvinia labored in the house or in the fields, there was no shortage of work: wheat, corn, sweet potatoes and cotton to plant and harvest, and 3 horses, 5 cows, 17 pigs and 20 sheep to care for, according to an 1860 agricultural survey.It is difficult to say who might have impregnated Melvinia, who gave birth to Dolphus around 1859, when she was perhaps as young as 15. At the time, Henry Shields was in his late 40s and had four sons ages 19 to 24, but other men may have spent time on the farm.�No one should be surprised anymore to hear about the number of rapes and the amount of sexual exploitation that took place under slavery; it was an everyday experience, � said Jason A. Gillmer, a law professor at Texas Wesleyan University, who has researched liaisons between slave owners and slaves. �But we do find that some of these relationships can be very complex.�In 1870, three of Melvinia�s four children, including Dolphus, were listed on the census as mulatto. One was born four years after emancipation, suggesting that the liaison that produced those children endured after slavery. She gave her children the Shields name, which may have hinted at their paternity or simply been the custom of former slaves taking their master�s surnames.Even after she was freed, Melvinia stayed put, working as a farm laborer on land adjacent to that of Charles Shields, one of Henry�s sons.But sometime in her 30s or 40s, census records show, Melvinia broke away and managed to reunite with former slaves from her childhood on the Patterson estate: Mariah and Bolus Easley, who settled with Melvinia in Bartow County, near the Alabama border. Dolphus married one of the Easleys� daughters, Alice, who is Mrs. Obama�s great-great-grandmother.A community �that had been ripped apart was somehow pulling itself back together,� Ms. Smolenyak said of the group in Bartow County.Still, Melvinia appears to have lived with the unresolved legacy of her childhood in slavery until the very end. Her 1938 death certificate, signed by a relative, says �don�t know� in the space for the names of her parents, suggesting that Melvinia, then in her 90s, may never have known herself.Sometime before 1888, Dolphus and Alice Shields continued the migration, heading to Birmingham, a boomtown with a rumbling railroad, an iron and steel industry and factories that attracted former slaves and their children from across the South.Dolphus Shields was in his 30s and very light skinned � some say he looked like a white man � a church-going carpenter who could read, write and advance in an industrializing town. By 1900, he owned his own home, census records show. By 1911, he had opened his own carpentry and tool sharpening business.A co-founder of First Ebenezer Baptist Church and Trinity Baptist Church, which later became active in the civil rights movement, he supervised Sunday schools at both churches, which still exist today, and at Regular Missionary Baptist Church.�He was the dean of the deacons in Birmingham,� said Helen Heath, 88, who attended church with him. �He was a serious man. He was about business.�He carried his family into the working-class, moving into a segregated neighborhood of striving black homeowners and renters. In his home, there was no smoking, no cursing, no gum chewing, no lipstick or trousers for ladies and absolutely no blues on the radio, which was reserved for hymns, remembered Bobbie Holt, 73, who was raised by Mr. Shields and his fourth wife, Lucy. She said the family went to church �every night of the week, it seemed like.�He carried peppermints for neighborhood children, Mrs. Holt said, and told funny stories about his escapades as a boy. But his family struggled.His first wife, Alice Easley Shields, moved around after they split up, working as a seamstress and a maid, and two of their sons stumbled.Robert Lee Shields, Mrs. Obama�s great-grandfather, married Annie Lawson in 1906 and worked as a laborer and a railroad porter but disappeared from the public record sometime around his 32nd birthday.Willie Arthur Shields, an inventor who obtained patents for improving dry cleaning operations, ended up working as a maintenance man, Mrs. Holt said.As for his ancestry, Dolphus Shields didn�t talk about it.�We got to the place where we didn�t want anybody to know we knew slaves; people didn�t want to talk about that,� said Mrs. Heath, who said she assumed he had white relatives because his skin color and hair texture �told you he had to be near white.�At a time when blacks despaired at the intransigence and violence of whites who barred them from voting, from most city jobs, from whites-only restaurants and from owning property in white neighborhoods, Dolphus Shields served as a rare link between the deeply divided communities.His carpentry shop stood in the white section of town, and he mixed easily and often with whites. �They would come to his shop and sit and talk,� Mrs. Holt said.Dolphus Shields firmly believed race relations would improve. �It�s going to come together one day,� he often said, Mrs. Holt recalled.By the time he died in 1950 at age 91, change was on the way. On June 9, 1950, the day that his obituary appeared on the front page of The Birmingham World, the black newspaper also ran a banner headline that read, �U.S. Court Bans Segregation in Diners and Higher Education.� The Supreme Court had outlawed separate but equal accommodations on railway cars and in universities in Texas and Oklahoma.Up North, his grandson, a painter named Purnell Shields, Mrs. Obama�s grandfather, was positioning his family to seize the widening opportunities in Chicago.But as his descendants moved forward, they lost touch with the past. Today, Dolphus Shields lies in a neglected black cemetery, where patches of grass grow knee-high and many tombstones have toppled.Mrs. Holt, a retired nursing assistant, said he came to her in a dream last month. She dug up his photograph, never guessing that she would soon learn that Dolphus Shields was a great-great-grandfather of the first lady.�Oh, my God,� said Mrs. Holt, gasping at the news. �I always looked up to him, but I would never have imagined something like this. Praise God, we�ve come a long way.�Michelle Obama among 10 best dressed women: People magazineLOS ANGELES: Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama, has made People magazine's list of the year's top ten best dressed women."Politics may be tougher than ever, but Obama has wowed along the campaign trail with confidence, in polished looks that bring to mind a famous former first lady," wrote People in an apparent reference to Jacqueline Kennedy.Michelle Obama, Rihanna Named To People's Best Dressed ListMichelle Obama is the first to admit she is a bargain hunter when it comes to fashion and it�s paid off as her effortless style has made People magazine�s Best Dressed list for 2008.When she was a guest on �The View,� one mention from Michelle noting that she bought her sundress off-the-rack at a chain store started a fashion frenzy for the item.Joining Michelle on the list, which didn�t rank the stars in any particular order, was Sarah Jessica Parker. Not only is her style sophisticated, but it takes a special kind of dresser to make a flowerpot hat look chic, which Sarah Jessica did at the �Sex and The City� movie premiere in London.In naming her to their list, People wrote Sarah Jessica �effortlessly mixes high-end and affordable prices,� no doubt referring to her Bitten line, which sells in the economical fashion chain store, Steve & Barry.Gwyneth Paltrow and her short dresses got her on to People�s list because �she plays up her legs,� according to the mag.As for Rihanna, it was her stylish hair that helped secure the singer�s spot on the list. She was also praised because she �straddles the line between sweet and street.�Also named to the best dressed list were supermodel and TV host Heidi Klum, singer Fergie, actress Charlize Theron and actresses Kate Hudson, Eva Mendes and Anne Hathaway.While People stopped short of naming a Worst Dressed list, they did call out several stars including �American Idol� judge Paula Abdul, actresses Lucy Liu, Sienna Miller and Tilda Swinton, and singers Solange Knowles and Tori Amos for wearing the �Worst Dresses.�Read more at http://www.accesshollywood.com/michelle-obama-rihanna-named-to-peoples-best-dressed-list_article_11297#tUhwfbeS2iJhjcDP.99Is Michelle Obama Diversifying Model Portfolios? Not So MuchWe're nearly halfway through New York's Mercedes Benz Fashion Week. And so far, the most constant theme is the fashion world's continual obsession with Michelle Obama. Questions abound: Will she show up? (No.) But is that the White House social secretary sitting next to Vogue's Anna Wintour? (Yes.) Which of these dresses might the first lady wear? (Probably few.) And which colorful sheaths were directly inspired by her? (Unclear, but it's safe to say several.)The claim is that Mrs. Obama has changed the fashion world with her carefully choreographed wardrobe choices, and it doesn't just translate to the clothes. Already this week, journalists have speculated whether the ethnic makeup of models on the runway might shift from favoring Caucasians to include more black models in an attempt to reflect America's newest fashion icon. In the New York Times, Guy Trebay wrote, "Already there are signs that the recent industry habits of exclusion may be undergoing a shift," citing an increase in the number of black men and women getting work in fashion in New York City. Over at New York Magazine, James Lim lauded Jason Wu's choice of a black model to open his show: "Does this mean the days of whitewashed runways are behind us?" he asks.The answer to that question: absolutely not. Not to be a downer in these exciting times, but if anything, Michelle Obama has merely drawn attention to the current crop of black models, while designers don't appear to have done anything to change their casting preferences. The shows this year still look overwhelmingly, almost unbelievably, white. Impressions can be deceiving, so in a quest for hard, empirical evidence, we visited Style.com and perused the site's slideshows of runway shows from Spring/Summer Fashion Week last September to figure out the differences in the number of black models between then and now when it comes to both America's most well-known designers and our first lady's personal favorites. Here's a look:THE OLD:Marc JacobsNotable for: being Marc JacobsThis Week: 4 black modelsSeptember: 3 black modelsDiane von FurstenbergNotable for: Wrap dresses, fabulousnessThis Week: 4 black modelsSeptember: 4 black modelsCaroline HerreraNotable for: dressing Hilary ClintonThis Week: 1 black modelSeptember: 2 black models (ouch!)THE NEW:ThakoonNotable for: dressing Michelle Obama at the DNCThis Week: 1 black modelSeptember: 1 black model (the same one, too!)Zero + Maria CornejoNotable for: dressing Michelle Obama on the train to D.C.This Week: 2 black modelsSeptember: 2 black modelsJason WuNotable for: Michelle Obama's inaugural gownThis Week: 4 black modelsSeptember: 1 black modelNarciso RodriguezNotable for: Election night controversyThis Week: 2 black modelsSeptember: 2 black modelsLest we be accused of tokenism, it's worth noting that these numbers don't tell a whole story and that runway diversity also includes the growing number of Asian, Latina and Indian women, as well as models of other varying ethnicities. But the informal survey above does suggest that designers both young and established haven't made much of the fact that one of the most inspiring women in these dour economic times happens to be African-American, and that there are likely many customers who would like to see greater black representation on the runway. To be fair, some small steps have been made to address the current moment in fashion: Maria Cornejo chose the black model Jeniel Williams to open her show and Thakoon had Jourdan Dunn close his show. Jason Wu should be lauded for using more women of color, but then again, he's the designer who has perhaps benefited the most from Obama's gown choices.And even in Wu's case, his choices likely have had little to do with inclusion. Instead, it's probably about good timing: for the last few years, younger black models have risen through the ranks, receiving attention from designers and fashion photographers alike. So when Jason Wu, Marc Jacobs and Diane von Furstenberg chose four black women for their shows, they picked from the same pool of experienced and expensive models: Jourdan Dunn, Chanel Iman, Arlenis Sosa, Sessilee Lopez and the former Miss Africa, Georgia Baddiel. These are the go-to girls of color, if you will. Their inclusion on more runways is great for their personal careers, but hiring pros like them signals little in the way of a renewed focus on diversity in fashion.Because this isn't just about Michelle Obama�even if it may be veiled in conversations about her. For years, fashion, like the country as a whole, has been accused of expressing latent racism by not including a broad spectrum of minorities (beyond the black/white paradigm) and remaining largely white. The designers can't be solely blamed for this, of course, as advertisers, fashion magazines and the modeling agencies themselves are the tastemakers for an entire industry.When it came to America, the November election showed that we've become at least somewhat more progressive. But when it comes to fashion? White remains the new black, which is too bad.Michelle Obama Finds Her Role on the World StageBarack Obama and his wife flew to London together. They have been staying together at Winfield House, the sprawling American ambassadorial residence in Regent's Park, and are photographed together regularly, boarding and leaving planes and helicopters, walking from cars, meeting with the Queen and assorted world leaders. But they move in completely different worlds.In the President's world, everything is collapsing � markets, housing prices, confidence. In the First Lady's world, everything is soaring � spirits, ballet dancers, ambitions. In Barack's world, expressions of optimism are carefully qualified. In Michelle's world, expressions of pessimism are almost unthinkable. For Barack, the big question is how he is going to save the world from economic and nuclear Armageddon. For Michelle, the big question is who made her darling cardigan with the sequins and the argyle print. (See photos of Michelle Obama's fashion.)"My husband � you know him. He is going to be very jealous of my afternoon," the First Lady said Thursday afternoon during a visit to a girls' school in London. "He is meeting with important people, but it is not as much fun as my afternoon." (See exclusive, behind-the-scenes pictures of the Obamas in Europe.)This was a rhetorical feint of sorts, since Michelle's whole point was that she was meeting with important people too, a group of about 200 proud teenagers from a mind-boggling variety of backgrounds. The Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School has about 1,000 students, all of them girls ages 11 to 17, two-thirds of whom speak English as a second language. Fifty-five languages are spoken at the school. Ninety percent of the students are ethnic minorities, and no single ethnic group makes up more than 21% of the student body. As a group, they treated Obama as if she were an American Queen, a personification of what they can only dream of becoming in a country where no minority has risen nearly as high as the Obamas."I am just very touched," Michelle told the girls, choking up with emotion as she spoke. "All of you are jewels." In the moment, it did not seem at all like an overstatement. For the better part of an hour, the girls had been performing for the First Lady, presenting a remarkable array of talent � for public speaking, for modern dance, for Shakespeare, for belting out ballads with names like "I'm Going All the Way." It was hard not to be inspired by the scene, but then that's what seems to happen around Michelle Obama these days.On Wednesday, the First Lady toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, the British Prime Minister's wife, finding peace amid the pain. After a makeup session with two female patients, she had tea. "It's an oasis," she said. "It's a quiet place that makes people feel whole." Hours later, she met with the Queen of England, appearing to breach rigid ancient protocol with the most human gesture, reciprocating Elizabeth II's light touch by gently draping her arm across the back of the Queen. (Read "The Queen and Mrs. Obama: A Breach in Protocol.")Then Thursday morning she was off to the Royal Opera, dressed in a sequined, patchwork cardigan, the kind of goofy outfit that in another context could get a teenage daughter eye rolls from her baffled parents. While world leaders tried to come up with a plan to relieve the record unemployment around the globe, Michelle Obama enjoyed the sinuous beauty of ballet. At the end, Brown tried to connect the two, delight and despair � an awkward task in such troubled days. "In this difficult time, with the difficult summit taking place down the road, you remind us all about the part that culture plays in keeping us all alive," she told the opera-house performers.At that very moment, Barack Obama was across town in plenary-session meetings with other national leaders at the G-20, discussing regulations, stimulus and funding for emerging markets that they hope will stem the enormous amounts of human suffering the world will endure over the coming months. The President had already met the day before with the Russians to discuss preventing nuclear apocalypse, with the Chinese to discuss the genocide in Sudan and with the South Koreans to discuss the pending missile launch by North Korea.Barack's and Michelle's experiences may seem like night and day, but there are similarities as well. Like the President, the First Lady has an ability to exude a calm confidence amid chaos. As she mingled with 12 other spouses of G-20 heads of state at the opera house Thursday, she looked at times reserved if not a bit shy. But it did not appear to be a shyness born of insecurity as much as her own nature. She was not trying too hard to impress anyone.And later in the day, when Michelle Obama finished speaking at the school, she spent time hugging each of the 24 girls who had joined her onstage after singing in a choir. Some, she hugged more than once. Then she bent down, kneeling on the lip of the stage, to hug the girls in the audience, sending a sudden shock through her Secret Service detail. The embraces did not seem awkward or forced; Michelle was simply celebrating the young talent around her and her newfound ability to inspire others. This is her new role, it seems, a balance to her husband's grim and sober task. "Nothing in my life's path would have predicted that I would be standing here," she told the girls. "I am an example of what is possible when girls, from the very beginning of their lives, are loved and nurtured by the people around them."And as she concluded, she switched to the first-person plural, suddenly speaking for more than just herself. "We are counting on every single one of you to be the best that you can be," she told the young women, many wearing Muslim headscarves, all sitting in rapt attention. "We know you can do it. We love you."Michelle Obama graces cover of Vogue magazineMichelle Obama graces the cover of next month's Vogue magazine, marking the second time a U.S. first lady has appeared on the front of one of the world's leading fashion magazines.Obama, 45, who has been hailed by both U.S. retailers and the media as a new fashion icon, donned a magenta sheath dress for the cover photo. The dress was designed by Jason Wu, who also created her white inaugural ball gown.Famed photographer Annie Leibovitz took the cover photo and several fashion shots featured inside the March edition of Vogue.With the exception of Bess Truman, every U.S. first lady since Lou Hoover in the 1930s has been featured in Vogue, but Obama is only the second presidential wife to appear on the cover, Vogue said. Hillary Clinton did so in 1998.Obama has won praise from fashionistas for mixing designer pieces with off-the-rack American brands like J. Crew and Gap.Vogue's editor-at-large, Andre Leon Talley said Obama selected the outfits worn for the photo shoot herself, from her own wardrobe, pairing designer wear with affordable clothes."She doesn't need any help. She loves fashion and knows what works for her. She's never had a conversation with me about, 'What do you think?' or 'How did this look?' And I'm glad for that."Obama told Vogue she loved clothes, but said comfort and fun was more important than following fashion."First and foremost, I wear what I love. That's what women have to focus on: what makes them happy and what makes them feel comfortable and beautiful. If I can have any impact, I want women to feel good about themselves and have fun with fashion," she said.While Obama discussed her views on fashion, she made clear family was her first priority, particularly caring for daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7."I'm going to try to take them to school every morning, as much as I can," Obama told the magazine. "But there's also a measure of independence. And obviously there will be times I won't be able to drop them off at all. I like to be a presence in my kids' school. I want to know the teachers; I want to know the other parents," she said.Michelle Obama makes Vogue coverPresident Barack Obama's wife Michelle is the cover girl for the March edition of fashion magazine Vogue.It is only the second time an American First Lady has taken the place of a model on a Vogue cover - the other was Hillary Clinton in 1998.Mrs Obama, who was photographed wearing outfits she chose herself, says she is aware her wardrobe is under scrutiny."I'm not going to pretend that I don't care about it. But I also have to be practical," she told Vogue magazine.Annie Leibovitz photographed Mrs Obama wearing a magenta silk dress designed by Jason Wu for the cover portrait.It is the second time she has chosen to wear one of his creations for a high-profile public appearance. She wore a long white gown by Wu for the inauguration balls on 20 January.Mrs Obama's sense of style has proved influential.On the day she dressed her family in clothes from J Crew for her husband's inauguration, the company's shares leapt 10%.In the accompanying interview for Vogue, Mrs Obama also talks about her role as a social hostess."We want entertaining in the White House to feel like America, that we are reminded of all the many facets of our culture. The Latino community, the Asian-American community, the African-American community... hip-hop, spoken word - we want to bring the youth in, for them to hear their voices in this," she said.On her self-declared role as "mom-in-chief" she will try to take her daughters Malia and Sasha to school every morning, though she acknowledges this may not always be possible."I like to be a presence in my kids' school. I want to know the teachers; I want to know the parents."Apart from Bess Truman, Vogue has photographed the wife of every American president since 1929 when President Herbert Hoover's wife, Lou Henry Hoover, was featured.Michelle Obama surprises Oscars by presenting Best Picture awardU.S. first lady Michelle Obama made a surprise and unprecedented appearance on Sunday's Oscars telecast when she presented the award for Best Picture, the first time a president or first lady has ever presented an Academy Award.Appearing live on screen from the White House in Washington, almost 3,000 miles from the Oscars ceremony in Hollywood, Obama praised the work of the movie industry before announcing the Iran hostage drama "Argo" the Best Picture winner.Wearing a silver evening dress, Obama said this year's nominated films had "made us laugh, made us weep and grip our armrests just a little bit tighter."Obama added: "They reminded us we can overcome any obstacles if we dig deep enough and hard enough. They are especially important for young people. Everyday they engage in the arts, they learn to open their imaginations ... and strive to reach those dreams.""Argo" director and co-producer Ben Affleck said he felt like he was "sort of hallucinating" when Obama presented the award."The fact that it was the first lady was an enormous honor ... it was very cool," Affleck said backstage after collecting the Best Picture trophy.Michelle Obama: As Barack�s First Lady, I Would Work to Help Working Families and Military FamiliesMilitary and working families would be my focus, Michelle Obama writes, along with a sleepover or twoA few weeks ago at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, I shared with the nation some of the many reasons why I believe my husband will be an extraordinary president. It was the biggest speech I'd ever given. When I was finished, I headed backstage with my daughters. They turned to me, breathless with excitement."Mom," Malia, our 10-year-old, said. "We have something important to tell you. We need to have a sleepover!"That snapped me out of speech mode, with the bright lights and applause, and back into the role I love: Mom. The next night, 15 giggling girls�my daughters, the Biden granddaughters, and friends�took over our hotel room.If Barack is elected president, I would be honored to be first lady. I would work daily on the issues closest to my heart: helping working women and families, particularly military families. But as my girls reminded me in Denver, even as first lady, my No. 1 job would still be Mom. At 7 and 10, our daughters are young. If we move to Washington, my first priority will be to ensure they stay grounded and healthy, with normal childhoods�including homework, chores, dance, and soccer.Our girls are the center of Barack's and my world. They're the reason he is running for president�to make the world a better place for them and for all children. For us, and for millions of Americans, that's what this election is about�making sure that America remains a country where everyone can fulfill their God-given potential.Barack and I have traveled to every corner of the country, talking with people about their lives and dreams. Their stories have touched our hearts and strengthened our resolve. They've made us more certain than ever that, despite any differences we may have, there is so much that unites us as Americans. But times are tough. Parents are working harder than ever to raise their kids, pay bills, help out their parents, and keep up with the rising cost of living. Caring for their families is their greatest joy�but it's harder to make ends meet.We've talked to mothers whose salaries can't cover the cost of groceries�but if they take a second job, they can't afford the additional cost of child care. More than 22 million working women don't have paid sick days. Millions of women are doing the same jobs as men�but they're earning less.It's even harder for military spouses. Their husbands and wives are away serving our nation for months at a time. So they have to be Mom and Dad. They're working, checking in on their in-laws, helping with homework, and doling out discipline�and every night, they're praying with all their hearts for their loved ones' safe return. These families aren't asking the government to fix their problems. They're asking for it to understand what's happening to their families and to find real ways to help.American stories. As first lady, I'd continue these conversations with working women and military spouses, and I'd take their stories back to Washington to make sure that the people who run our country know how their policies touch their constituents' lives.The struggles of America's families aren't new to Barack. He was raised by a single mom who put herself through school and built a career that she loved while still finding time to read to him each morning. So, he knows how heroic America's parents can be. That's why he is committed to restoring the middle class, cutting taxes for 95 percent of all working Americans, establishing pay equity for women, and expanding family leave. He also knows that when our military goes to war, their families go with them. He's a strong advocate for predictable deployments and for better healthcare�including mental health care�for returning servicemen and women.These issues are my passions. Win or lose on November 4, I'll keep working to find solutions that make a real difference in people's lives. If Barack has the chance to serve as president, we will fill our home with talk of how to better serve our nation's families.And occasionally, when our daughters insist, we'll host sleepovers, too.Michelle Obama Is Making Herself a Stay-at-Home Mom, Not the MediaWhen in doubt, blame the media. That used to be an overused conservative tactic. Now it's being adopted, apparently, by the Kool-Aid imbibing Obama fans who are so blind to the Obamas' flaws they scramble mightily to find someone other than the Obamas to blame for these flaws.Let me state for the record that I am neither conservative nor liberal, Democrat nor Republican, feminist nor antifeminist. Philosophical or partisan labels make me nervous and are never entirely accurate if there's a functioning brain inside the person so labeled. We all think for ourselves and have beliefs that differ from doctrinal rigidity. That is, unless that self-labeled person is a member of a particular political party and is angling for a job with that party (the old "What's in it for me" routine).As for President-elect Obama, I probably agree with him on 90 percent of his environmental agenda, 90 percent of his diversity agenda, and 20 percent of his tax-policy agenda. I am extremely disappointed so far with what I see developing as his gender agenda: his position on women's rights. I could go on, but my point is I dislike both parties equally for very different reasons, so any reader comments along the lines of "you Democrat, you" or "you Republican, you" are flat-out wrong.I met Rebecca Traister of Salon.com in Denver at the Democratic National Convention. We were both speaking on a panel of journalists. She seemed quite bright, but her latest article reflects little of that intelligence. Her vision of Michelle Obama is clearly obscured to the point of blindness by her worshipful take on what she calls the Bam-a-lot family.The gist of her article is that Michelle Obama is being "momified" by the media. She writes that the media are paying more attention to Obama's clothes and role as mother than to her educational and career credentials.Wake up, woman! Michelle Obama and Senator Obama's handlers, not the media, are doing that to her. Obama herself described her role as first lady as "Mom-in-Chief." She gave up her own career to help her husband pursue his. She clearly plans to emulate the retro Laura Bush rather than the career-oriented Sen. Hillary Clinton. From the Associated Press:Valerie Jarrett, a longtime family friend who is helping lead the president-elect's transition team, said in a broadcast interview Sunday: "Having a seat at . . . the table and being co-president is not something she's interested in doing."First ladies often start out slow, then pick up the pace as they become more comfortable in their roles.An Ivy League-educated lawyer, Michelle Obama was criticized during the campaign, and Jarrett's comments could be taken as the beginning of an effort to lower her profile, de-emphasize her adviser role, and present a more traditional, first lady persona, possibly to avoid repeating the mistake the Clintons made.Though Barack Obama said no such thing, Bill Clinton joked during the 1992 campaign that the country would get two for one if he was elected.Another example: I blogged last week that when the Obamas were in Chicago, Senator Obama went along with Michelle to a parent-teacher conference. I was told of that meeting by a close friend who is a high-level Democratic fundraiser. But Obama's media staffers did not push that story. So, it ended up barely covered�it was in the last paragraph of a CNN sidebar on the Obama children's move to Washington�rather than on the front pages.On Friday morning, before the president-elect met with his advisers on the troubled economy and before his first news conference since the election scheduled for the afternoon, Barack and Michelle Obama went to a parent-teacher conference at the University of Chicago Lab School.So please, Ms. Traister, get a grip and stop foaming at least long enough to realize this is not some media conspiracy to turn Michelle Obama into Mrs. Mom but an Obama staff contrivance to tone down Michelle Obama's negatives. After she made campaign trail comments about being proud of her country for the first time (only following her husband's success) and disparaging Senator Clinton, the campaign had no choice but to tone her down, or the country would have turned on her husband.It's sad both she and Senator Obama are going along with it. It's beginning to look as if they're a couple much more concerned with racial than gender parity. As one who has spent her life fighting for both, it's distressing for me to see gender parity fall by the wayside.Michelle Obama Has a Rabbi in Her FamilyWhile Barack Obama has struggled to capture the Jewish vote, it turns out that one of his wife�s cousins is the country�s most prominent black rabbi � a fact that has gone largely unnoticed.Michelle Obama, wife of the Democratic presidential nominee, and Rabbi Capers Funnye, spiritual leader of a mostly black synagogue on Chicago�s South Side, are first cousins once removed. Funnye�s mother, Verdelle Robinson Funnye (born Verdelle Robinson) and Michelle Obama�s paternal grandfather, Frasier Robinson Jr., were brother and sister.Funnye (pronounced fuh-NAY) is chief rabbi at the Beth Shalom B�nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in southwest Chicago. He is well-known in Jewish circles for acting as a bridge between mainstream Jewry and the much smaller, and largely separate, world of black Jewish congregations, sometimes known as black Hebrews or Israelites. He has often urged the larger Jewish community to be more accepting of Jews who are not white.Funnye�s famous relative gives an unexpected twist to the much-analyzed relationship between Barack Obama and Jews in this presidential campaign. On the one hand, Jewish political organizers, voters and donors played an essential role in Obama�s rise to power in Chicago, including some of the city�s wealthiest and most prominent families. But the Illinois senator has struggled to overcome suspicions in some parts of the Jewish community, including skepticism about his stance on Israel and discredited but persistent rumors that he is secretly a Muslim.Funnye, who described himself as an independent, said he has not been involved with the Obama campaign but that he has donated money and was cheering it on.�I know that her grandfather and her father and my mom and all of our relatives that are now deceased would be so very, very proud of both of them,� Funnye told the Forward.Michelle Obama and the Obama campaign did not respond to requests for comment.Funnye told the Forward that he has known Michelle Obama (born Michelle Robinson) all her life. His mother and her father, Frasier Robinson III, enjoyed a close relationship, and Funnye said he saw Michelle several times a year when they were growing up, mostly at family functions and on occasional visits to her house.�Her father was like the glue of our family,� Funnye said. �He always wanted to keep the family very connected and to stay in touch with each other.�Funnye, 56, said he and Michelle, 44, were not especially close growing up, but he remembers her as �energetic and smart and very caring.�The two fell out of touch when they grew older and went their separate ways but then reconnected years later when Michelle Obama was working for the University of Chicago and Funnye was leading a local social service organization called Blue Gargoyle. Funnye also worked with Barack Obama, then a state senator, who came and spoke at events for the organization. When Barack and Michelle Obama married, Funnye and his family attended the wedding.Although Funnye�s congregation describes itself as Ethiopian Hebrew, it is not connected to the Ethiopian Jews, commonly called Beta Israel, who have immigrated to Israel en masse in recent decades. It is also separate from the Black Hebrews in Dimona, Israel, and the Hebrew Israelite black supremacist group whose incendiary street harangues have become familiar spectacles in a number of American cities.Funnye converted to Judaism and was ordained as a rabbi under the supervision of black Israelite rabbis, then went through another conversion supervised by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis. He serves on the Chicago Board of Rabbis.Funnye�s relationship with the Obama family was reported in the Chicago Jewish News in an article dated August 22. A Wall Street Journal article in April reported that the aspiring first lady had a cousin (whom the paper mistakenly referred to as a second cousin) who is a prominent black rabbi but did not mention Funnye by name.The rabbi�s familial connection with the Democratic presidential nominee is also a matter of common knowledge in Funnye�s synagogue.�He really jumped on everyone�s radar after the 2004 convention,� Funnye said. �That�s when some people said, �Isn�t he related to you or something?� I said, �Yeah, he�s married to my cousin, and she�s making him everything that he is.��Michelle Obama's Savvy SacrificeWhen she takes the stage at the Democratic National Convention Monday evening, Michelle Obama will surely discuss her husband's many achievements and the promise for America that his groundbreaking candidacy represents. What she is less likely to talk about is just how instrumental she has been to launching her husband's political trajectory or that this tough, razor-smart Chicago native had to sacrifice many of her own career ambitions along the way.From almost the earliest days of their personal and professional partnership, Barack Obama's political aspirations have guided Michelle's path. At the end of the summer of 1989, Obama was an intern at Sidley Austin, a prestigious Chicago law firm that also happened to employ a young intellectual-property lawyer and Harvard Law grad named Michelle Robinson. Obama was offered a permanent job at Sidley, though senior partner Newton Minow wasn't surprised when he turned the firm down; the two had often discussed the intern's political plans, and Minow had pledged to help Obama in his pursuit of a place in public life. But Obama didn't just turn the firm down. Minow, a former Federal Communication Commission chairman, recalls that Obama told him to take a seat: "You may not want to help me after you hear the rest of what I've got to say. I'm taking Michelle with me." (See pictures of Barack Obama's family tree.)"You no good, worthless �" Minnow said, jumping up angrily. "Hold it," Obama said, raising a hand. "We're going to get married."Most women might not appreciate their boyfriend's effectively giving notice on their behalf. Michelle, though, didn't seem to mind. Not only were they engaged a year later, but sure enough, Michelle surprised her family and friends and left the law to go into public service. It was a move that would prove fateful for both her and her husband: the contacts she made were invaluable, some say essential, to his state senate and U.S. Senate races.The child of Marian and Fraser Robinson, a stay-at-home mother and a city pump operator, Michelle was raised in a close-knit family that ate every meal together, played Monopoly and read together. "Nobody emphasized public service. What was emphasized was doing what you love to do and you'll be good at whatever you do," says Craig Robinson, Michelle's brother, who left his banking job after a decade to coach college basketball. That didn't stop Robinson from being surprised when Michelle left Sidley Austin to become an assistant to Chicago mayor Richard Daley. "Her father asked her, 'Don't you want to pay your student loans?' " her mother, Marian, recalls. One of her college roommates, Angela Acree, remembers being stunned. "I'm sure at Sidley she made more money than her parents ever made," says Acree. "It just seemed incredible at the time that she'd leave."The move was not without its benefits. Michelle Obama's stint at the mayor's office gave her, and her husband, access to Chicago's political class. Combined with her own Southside roots � she went to high school with Santita Jackson, the Rev. Jesse Jackson's daughter � Michelle's job gave her husband entr�e into the best political machine in Illinois, augmenting her ties to Jackson's powerful civil rights group, Rainbow Push."Michelle is a tremendous asset," says Habitat Inc. CEO Valerie Jarrett, a close friend of both Obamas and a key campaign adviser. As Daley's deputy chief of staff at the time, Jarrett hired Michelle to help troubleshoot for companies having problems navigating the city's bureaucracy. "Her being from Chicago, from the Southside of Chicago, was an asset to Barack in terms of enhancing his ties to the community."But if Michelle helped give Obama an invaluable new base in Chicago politics, he helped her get back in touch with her home base. It was at the end of her first year as an associate at the law firm that she had been assigned to mentor Obama. In a now famous story, she at first refused to date him, feeling their work relationship would make a romance improper. But Obama's courtship helped her discover anew her childhood home on Chicago's Southside. Dates often took them to church basements and protests. "He could've gone to Wall Street; those offers were available to him. But instead Barack bussed these young mothers down to City Hall to help them find their voice and advocate for change," Michelle told an audience in Orangeburg, S.C., earlier this year.As Obama gradually moved further away from grass-roots organizing and into business and politics, Michelle seemed to fill the vacuum. After 18 months, she left the mayor's office to head up the Chicago office of a new charity that was forming: Public Allies, which helps place young people at nonprofits."Everyone had said at the time that the best young organizer in Chicago was Barack," says Paul Schmitz, CEO of Public Allies. The group invited Obama to join their board. But when they started to look for someone to head up the Chicago office, Obama recommended his fianc�e and resigned when the nonprofit began to court her in earnest. "At a time when the average age of our staff was 23, she was like drafting Brett Favre for the Packers," Schmitz says. "Michelle was 29 when we hired her. She had a law degree from Harvard, had worked for the mayor, for a corporate law firm. Comparatively, I'd worked a telemarketing group. Frankly, we were surprised that she wanted to do it."During her nearly four years with the group, Michelle set fund-raising marks that remain records for the organization. In the process, she developed an unparalleled network of young activists. "She was a connector. They were a power couple. They helped each other along the way," says Craig Huffman, a graduate student from the Southside whom Michelle took under her wing and recommended for the charity's board. Huffman was drawn into Obama's orbit and, like dozens of Michelle's other prot�g�s, volunteered for Barack Obama's campaigns. "Each ally was placed with a not-for-profit, about 20 to 30 a year. When you think of the number of people who got to know who Michelle was, and by extension Barack, that's a whole generation from all over Chicago," Huffman says.Michelle went on to work as an associate dean of students at the University of Chicago, launching a community-service program for undergrads before moving to the university's medical school to become vice president of external relations, a fancy title for the person who helps the well-endowed school relate to its struggling Hyde Park neighborhood. She sponsored yet more volunteer programs, helped expand the hiring of local labor and launched a program that found ER patients clinics for long-term care.Eventually, the money she had initially walked away from in corporate law did come. Her salary last year between the university and six boards approached $500,000. In addition to serving on the boards of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Michelle also worked for Wal-Mart supplier Tree House Foods � a board from which she resigned when her husband criticized the retailing giant's labor practices. Asked in an interview about being the breadwinner of the family, Michelle is shocked by the notion. "Me? No! Barack had, like, four jobs, always," she laughs. "No, really. Barack's a hustler. I shouldn't say hustler, but he's a humper in terms of work."The division of responsibilities in the Obama household, however, hasn't always been a laughing matter. In his second book, The Audacity of Hope, Obama talks about Michelle's rage at his ever increasing absence: "My wife's anger toward me seemed barely contained. 'You only think about yourself,' she would tell me. 'I never thought I'd have to raise a family alone.' "Michelle may have envisioned giving her children the idyllic childhood that she'd had, but she had to know that Obama was far from a city pump operator with regular hours, nor did she show any real inclination to be a stay-at-home mom. But it is her connection to traditional middle-class values that drives her still to make an effort to put her children first and seemingly removes any desire to run for public office herself, though many have suggested it over the years. Her hint of nuclear-family nostalgia is also what helps make this very strong woman a much less threatening figure to the audiences who have throughout the campaign warmed to her homespun, sensitive speaking style. That down-to-earth appeal should be on full display Monday night, when she appears in her biggest venue yet. But that is only part of the real Michelle Obama. The country wouldn't get a two-for-one Bill and Hillary presidency if she were to become First Lady, but it would definitely get a lot more than many people realize.BOUCHET ACADEMY | Kids at Michelle Obama's old school see reflectionWhen Principal Kim Sims of Chicago's Bouchet Math and Science Academy used to talk to kids about misbehavior, one favorite line was, "How would your parents feel about this?''But these days, Sims is using another approach.I ask them, 'How do you think Barack Obama would feel about this?' " Sims said.The U.S. senator and president-elect from Illinois has become a new staple in schools nationwide. The American Federation of Teachers Web site already features lesson plans that weave Obama into social studies, language arts and technology classes.But Obama has been cited in more than just academic lessons. Teachers are using him as a motivational tool.The election of the nation's first African-American president has inspired kids nationwide, including at Bouchet, an overwhelming black, low-income Chicago public school at 73rd and Jeffery.As eighth-grader India Allen, 13, put it: "Now that Barack Obama was elected president, anything is possible. Before, nobody could think a black person could be in the White House.''Obama's success has special meaning at Bouchet. Back in the day when Bouchet was called Bryn Mawr, Michelle Obama skipped second grade here, attended gifted classes and graduated as salutatorian. And now, a student who walked these halls is packing up for the White House."She started off just like us and look how far she came,'' said eighth-grader Denika Williams, 14.In classroom 303, where Michelle Obama once sat, the reading material in the "African American Center'' includes articles about Thurgood Marshall, Jesse Owens, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama.Asked to write about a person who inspired them, some girls picked Michelle Obama, said sixth-grade teacher Jackie Ford.A huge picture of Michelle Obama now hangs from one blackboard, carrying the white chalk caption "Our First Lady.''And Barack Obama's picture is the 44th in a long line of presidential pictures that line the top of another blackboard."You used to tell your child, 'You can be anything you want.' Well, this is proof,'' said Ford, pointing to Obama's picture, which sits next to that of George Bush. "It's picture proof.''Kids in seventh-grade teacher Johnny Lomax's classroom have been reading, writing and computing about Obama for weeks.They converted the electoral delegate count for Obama into decimals, percentages and fractions. They used the last presidential debate to "compare and contrast'' how Obama and Republican opponent John McCain stood on various issues. They learned about sequences by studying the trajectory of Obama's political career."This is a person they can relate to,'' Lomax said.Lomax also uses Obama to motivate kids he works with as a coach. Citing Obama's exercise routine, Lomax urges students to use exercise to work out their aggressions."Barack Obama walks, he runs, he works out," Lomax said. "He said it relaxes his mind. I use that to tell kids to run and work out.''When kids are loathe to do their homework, Sims said, "I quote Barack Obama.'' She reminds them that as a child, Obama got up at 4 in the morning to study English with his mother.At elite Whitney Young Magnet, where Michelle Obama graduated high school in 1981, British literature teacher Charlene Floreni said kids across races connect with Obama for a lot of reasons.One Whitney Young African-American student said simply, "He has hair like mine,'' Floreni said. The son of Indian immigrants identified with Obama as "someone of color,'' she said. One white student in her class was impressed with Obama's intelligence."We are using him to inspire kids,'' said Sims. "He has called all of us to challenge ourselves. . . . That bar has been raised.''Her plan went awry, but Michelle Obama doesn't mindMichelle Obama stands off to the side of her husband. It is four days after his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, and Barack Obama, U.S. Senate candidate, is giving yet another speech. As he often does during his speeches, he introduces her, half-jokingly, as his "no-nonsense wife."They are in Ottawa, the first stop on a post-convention tour that is taking them and their two daughters to 30 counties and 39 cities Downstate over five days.From the national stage in Boston to backyard fundraisers in small Illinois towns, Michelle Obama, who directs community affairs for the University of Chicago Hospitals, is emerging as the pragmatic, smart woman who not only helps keep her husband's ego in check, but also is there to remind him of what is important. She juggles it all because she always has been a woman with "a plan."Her own story illustrates, though, that plans are subject to change--and chance.Always a disciplined and serious student, the former Michelle Robinson followed her plan from early on. It took her to Princeton University, to Harvard Law School, and on to a career at one of Chicago's top law firms. Then she met Barack Obama, a smart, charismatic young lawyer who changed her plans forever.Michelle was working at Sidley Austin Brown & Wood. Barack, who had just finished his first year at Harvard Law, was a summer associate there, and Michelle, only a few years out of law school herself, was his adviser.The two had a lot in common, except when it came to this: He wanted to date her. She had other ideas."I was more focused on my plan," she says while finishing a decidedly unhurried lunch at La Petite Folie, one of her favorite Hyde Park restaurants. "I had made this proclamation to my mother the summer I met Barack, 'I'm not worrying about dating . . . I'm going to focus on me.'"Considering him a "friend," who was also "a great guy ... cute, really smart," she tried introducing him to other female friends.He wasn't interested."He wanted to take me out and I didn't know that until he asked me out," she says.She resisted, telling him, "I'm your adviser. Certainly that's going to look bad. That's just way too predictable. [We are] the only two black people here, and [we're] going to start dating?'"I'm thinking, `No, that's just tacky,'" she recalls.Eventually, the planner was persuaded and the date took place.Now, 12 years of married life later, the ardent, persistent suitor is running to become the junior U.S. senator from Illinois, and the planner, well, she's adjusting to the uncertainties of political life. But, in this instance, she knows, the best-laid plans mean nothing until Election Day.One way she has been able to manage the shifting sands of politics, she says, "is to know that I have to let go of the plan, which is my nature. And it's driving me crazy, because I don't have a plan. So I have to mentally let go of the plan and [say] `we'll figure it out.'"Also her nature: a calm, direct manner that comes through whether she's in a crowded meeting hall or sitting alone with her husband. Those who know her say she has always been pragmatic, balanced."The poise that you see is genuine," says her older brother Craig Robinson. "She is quite comfortable in all situations."David Mosena, who hired her to be his deputy chief of staff when he worked for Mayor Richard Daley in the early '90s, says, "She has her feet solidly on the ground, both of them. There's not a bone of superficiality in her. She is the real deal. ... She is very comfortable with herself."Staying saneAs the countdown to Election Day enters a critical phase, and the prospect of making postelection plans becomes inevitable, Obama makes psychic and emotional space a priority for herself.She has made a deal with herself: Remain sane."I cannot be crazy, because then I'm a crazy mother and I'm an angry wife."What I notice about men, all men, is that their order is me, my family, God is in there somewhere, but me is first. And for women, me is fourth, and that's not healthy."Staying healthy involves working out (at 5 a.m.) four days a week; keeping up with the regular activities of daughters Malia, 6, and Sasha, 3, so they "retain that family bond"; and not missing her Friday afternoon hair and manicure appointments. And, as much as possible, she and her husband still have regular date nights.Barack Obama knows his wife is making sacrifices as she supports his run for the Senate."She's been an enormous help, mainly by just keeping our family focused on family," he says. He also knows she's really not all that impressed with the hype that now surrounds his campaign. Sure, she "cares about her community and her country," he says, but "she's much more concerned with the kind of father I am, or the kind of husband I am than she is with whether I give a nice speech at the convention."Michelle Obama: Mom First, Political Wife SecondMichelle Obama wants you to know she's a mom first, political wife second.So while she's flying to South Carolina to spend four days campaigning for her husband, she'll take a minute to check an e-mail from her 9-year-old daughter Malia's teacher.The e-mail this morning caught her off guard. It said that Malia had been talking about "scary people" and "kidnapping" being one of the things she finds "un-cool" during a class discussion. As it turned out, Obama told a gathering of women in Greenville there was nothing to be concerned about.Little Malia was only joking, she told her panicked mom by phone."I shouldn't say that in front of the cameras," Michelle Obama said as she quickly glanced at a gaggle of reporters in the backMeet Mrs. ObamaJust three days before the South Carolina primary, there is an intense focus on the words of the spouses of the front-runners. Just ask former President Bill Clinton."Look at all these people! Where did you all come from?" Michelle Obama asked as she entered the ladies lunch in Greenville.She seemed genuinely surprised to be the subject of so much attention.Michelle Obama spoke to the 150 or so women at the Lazy Goat restaurant, shook some hands and posed for photos. She declined to take any questions from reporters and said nothing directly about Hillary Clinton -- or her famous spouse.But she did speak passionately about her life as a working mom and the reasons she thinks she deserves to be first lady.Michelle Obama still holds a part-time position as vice president for community and external affairs at he University of Chicago Hospitals. Last year she scaled back her hours to part-time to make room for helping her husband's campaign.She has said that she carries two BlackBerries while out on the campaign trail -- one for work and the other for the campaign trail.Personal TouchMichelle Obama's speech Wednesday stood in contrast to the typical speech former President Clinton has delivered on the trail.He dwells on the details of policy -- exhaustive explanations of his wife's positions on health care, Iraq, education and other subjects. The Illinois senator's spouse highlights the personal.Obama began with a story she rarely tells in public. She described what it was like deciding whether to go back to work after having her second child, Sasha."Every minute after I had my first child I questioned my decisions," Obama said as women in the audience nodded along. One day she would love work. The next day she would feel like quitting.She told of interviewing for a new job when Sasha was just 4 months old. She didn't think she wanted the job, so she tried to sabotage the interview by bringing the baby along, nursing Sasha just before the interview and demanding a high salary.She got the job. But she struggled with the balance, she said. She still does, saying she worries about her children every day."We've been told we can have it all. The truth of the matter is that you can't. You can't have it all at the same time."Obama said her husband gets it."He's watched my struggle and the pain that I have had as a woman."Obama said her support for her husband "comes straight from my motherhood bones".Generation NextObama also said the nation is too cynical and afraid, and she worries about the next generation.Michelle Obama, Reluctant No MoreDENVER � When her husband ran for Congress in 2000, Michelle Obama groused so much about handshaking and fund-raising that Arthur Sussman, then her boss at the University of Chicago, finally asked if she truly could not find a single thing about campaigning to enjoy.Mrs. Obama thought for a moment. Visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas, she allowed.Eight years later, the once reluctant campaigner is at the center of a multimedia charm offensive that may be the most closely managed spousal rollout in presidential campaign history. On Monday night, Mrs. Obama delivered a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention, preceded by an intricately made biographical video, a touch usually afforded to candidates, not their wives.A relative newcomer to campaigning and the first black woman with a serious shot at first ladyhood, Mrs. Obama is a softer, smoother presence on the trail than she was at the start of the race.Her basic message � the stirring life story, the full-throated advocacy for her husband, the maternal warmth � has remained constant. But instead of laying down challenges to her audiences, she solicits their concerns and showers them with empathy. She used to appear on news programs; now she gives interviews to �The View� and Ladies� Home Journal. On Monday night she wore a designer dress, but lately she has more often sported a cheap-chic approach to fashion that might be called the economic crisis look: fewer designer pieces, more $79 Gap sundresses.Now, in Denver and for the next 10 weeks, Mrs. Obama�s agenda is a double one. She must continue to refashion her own occasionally harsh public image in warmer tones. But that is only one of the two life stories she must sell to voters. Worried that Mr. Obama�s far-flung upbringing and his lack of deep roots leave some voters unsure and untrusting, the campaign is essentially substituting Mrs. Obama�s family background for his own.Mr. Obama has few family members who can serve as surrogates. Just last week, a European magazine located one of the Kenyan half-siblings he barely knows, living destitute in a shanty. (The Texas Republican Party promptly turned the news into an attack ad.)So on Monday night, the campaign filled the stage and screen with Mrs. Obama�s family: her basketball-coach brother, Craig Robinson; her homemaker-turned-secretary mother, Marian; and the memory of her father, Frasier, a city worker stricken with multiple sclerosis. (When her father was alive, the family barely talked about his disease, Craig Robinson said in an interview last year; now Mrs. Obama mentions it at nearly every campaign stop.)Like the most famous of reassuring biographical videos, Bill Clinton�s �The Man From Hope,� Mrs. Obama�s film, �South Side Girl,� roots her in a specific, vivid place, the South Side of Chicago. As her mother tells Mrs. Obama�s story in a voice wavering with age, pictures of Mrs. Obama flash across the screen: as a child with pigtails, big brown eyes and an Easter basket, then as an adult with a child running into her arms.Mrs. Obama�s presentation touched just a bit on her own career, as a lawyer, community organizer and hospital executive, concentrating instead on her roles as a daughter, a mother, a sister and a wife.Mr. Obama is �the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer,� she said in her speech, describing him �inching along at a snail�s pace, peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror, feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands.�Since she left her job as a hospital administrator to campaign and care for her daughters, Malia and Sasha, full time, some feminist critics have complained that Mrs. Obama sacrificed her own work for her husband�s. But from the very start, the Obama marriage was a kind of professional symbiosis, a partnership between two passionately ambitious people who found they could rise higher in the world together than alone.The two Harvard-educated lawyers met at a law firm where she was assigned to guide Mr. Obama, a summer associate. From there, they tag-teamed their way through Chicago, sharing mentors, organizational ties and interests.Mr. Obama turned his wife into a community organizer, and she eventually worked for some of his associates. Mrs. Obama, in turn, introduced him to some of the ambitious young African-American businessmen and civic leaders who would help fuel his political rise. Now they have fully fused their careers into one enterprise that has taken them farther than ever before.The evening of the Iowa caucuses, the Obamas, who wanted to be away from the television, gathered their closest friends at a seafood restaurant in a Des Moines mall, where Mrs. Obama stood to give a toast. Everyone in the room knew that she had never really wanted her husband in politics, that she had once resented his absences and had expressed severe reservations before he entered the presidential race.But now she stood and gave a more private, tender version of her campaign speech, misting up as she talked about her husband and his candidacy. �Here�s to my husband, the man I love and the man I believe would be the best president,� she said, according to Sandra Matthews, a friend.Just then, a campaign aide broke in with news: the television networks were calling the state for Obama. As the room erupted in jubilation, as friends hugged, ignored their entrees and knocked over wineglasses, friends say, Mrs. Obama simply looked stunned.Michelle Obama on Campaign, FamilyAs Barack Obama's campaign for the Democratic nomination stretches beyond Super Tuesday, his wife Michelle spoke with The Wall Street Journal's Monica Langley about the run and the family stresses involved. Below are edited excerpts.The Wall Street Journal: What don't folks know about you?Michelle Obama: I'm really funny and fun to be around. I'm very sarcastic &hellip; works wonders in a room when you see the movement in my face or intonation in my voice&hellip; . But sarcasm doesn't translate in print &hellip; [Consequently,] I've cut back on it, because I don't want that to be the story.WSJ: What do you like least about this presidential run?Mrs. Obama: What I like least is the gamesmanship of politics &hellip; I don't watch the debates &hellip; I don't mind being in tense situations; I just don't like watching folks in them. I never liked watching my brother's basketball games, either.WSJ: You famously made your husband quit smoking to get your blessing for his run for president. But do you give him a break when he's under stress?Michelle Obama: I told him, "Figure out another coping mechanism." Barack is doing the Nicorette gum instead.WSJ: How are your daughters [Malia, 9 years old, and Sasha, 6] handling their father's presidential run?Michelle Obama: Malia is starting to ask: "What's the impact? If Dad wins, will I finish my school year?" She's indicated she would have some ambivalence. She said, "I want Daddy to win because I think he would be a great president." But she checked to see if she has permission to be happy if he doesn't win. She asked, "Dad, how will you feel if you don't win?" He said, "I'll be fine." She said, "Good."WSJ: How do they handle your departures to campaign? On this day, you're hitting events in New York and Connecticut.Michelle Obama: Malia asked, "Where are you traveling to now, Mom? Try to have a good time." My goal is to keep things as normal as possible for the girls as long as possible ... continuing with the play dates, school, activities.WSJ: With Mr. Obama traveling almost nonstop, are you doing anything differently with your daughters?Michelle Obama: Without Barack there in the morning, the girls and I have "snuggle time" in my bed. I turn on the lights and we stay there cuddling &hellip; have deep conversations and talk about what it would be like if we could stay in bed all day but that wouldn't be realistic, we wouldn't learn to read&hellip;How Michelle Obama Does ItAge: 44Hometown: ChicagoMichelle's Family: Husband Barack, 47; children Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7How do you balance being the wife of a presidential candidate and a mother to two small children?"My daughters are my first and foremost priority. Because Barack is away so much on the campaign trail, from the start he and I decided we would build my schedule around the girls to make sure they stay happy and healthy. So I'm only on the road campaigning a couple of days per week, and mostly only on day trips, so that in the evening I can hop back on the plane to head home, where I'm greeted by two beaming little faces. That way, the girls never really feel that I'm gone and are able to maintain a sense of normalcy."What's been most interesting for you on the campaign trail?"The roundtable discussions with working women have come to be my favorite and most meaningful campaign events. These conversations really reinforce for me that, no matter our race, age, party, socioeconomic status, or hometown, we're all so much more alike than different: We all love our families and our country, and we all just want to make the world we live in a better place. Women everywhere are engaged in similar juggling acts of balancing work and family, trying to fix problems in their lives that we don't do nearly enough to address in Washington. It's been so rewarding to get the chance to talk about Barack's plans that will really address the needs and concerns of women trying to keep their families healthy and financially secure, and to use these conversations to help inform his policies."Who provides childcare when you're campaigning?"My mom lives nearby and takes care of the girls when I'm away. They know that if Mommy and Daddy can't be there, they have Grandma, and we all know there's nothing better than Grandma! She has been the strongest source of support all of my life, and I'm so grateful for her love and compassion throughout all of the wonderful chaos of this campaign. She's our family's rock."What type of mother would your daughters say you are?"They'd say I'm a hard worker who expects them to always put forth their best efforts and above all, not to let anything stand in their way. I encourage them to be independent and free-thinking, and to take the lead on things like making their beds and getting school work done without being reminded. They would also definitely say that their Mommy loves to cuddle and play with them! The most precious part of my day is when the three of us snuggle up together in bed to share stories and chat about what's going on in their lives."What's your busiest time of day?"The morning. I get up between 5 and 6 a.m. to get the girls ready for school, prepare breakfast, clean up, and put myself together � it's bags flying, arms reaching, feet shuffling, and little voices saying 'Mom!' We're out the door by 7:30, and on days when I'm campaigning, I'm on a plane by 9."What would you do with an extra hour in your day?"I would spend every moment of it with my family."How do you and Barack stay connected?"We're very good about it. We talk on the phone every day, no matter what. And neither of us goes anywhere without our Blackberries, so we chat throughout the day, even if it's just little notes between campaign events."How do you spend family time?"We love outdoor activities, like riding bikes and swimming. If the weather's bad, we curl up on the couch and watch a movie or read a book. Barack and Malia have read all of the Harry Potter books together out loud."You've said you negotiated an agreement in which Barack gave up smoking in exchange for your support in the campaign. How else is health important to you?"It's true � that was one of the conditions for Barack to run! A proper diet and regular exercise have always been important to me, for both the physical and mental benefits. I try to hit the gym for an hour three or four times per week, which helps me keep up with the hectic campaign schedule � and makes up for some of the campaign snacking! On the road, I talk to a lot of women about the importance of their well-being; we women often put ourselves last on our 'to do' lists, and we need to take better care of ourselves."Do you have a guilty pleasure?"Yes. French fries!"What would it mean to you to be the first African-American First Lady?"My thoughts go straight to my girls and how it would affect their lives and how they view the world. Regardless of who wins the election, they will grow up in an America where having an African-American president is normal. The confidence that this campaign will instill in their minds, and in the minds of children across the country, is something that I've always hoped for."What issues would be most important to you as First Lady?"At the top of my mind is finding ways to support military families and working mothers. I'm also very interested in national service. I ran an AmeriCorps program in Chicago, working with young leaders to help communities, and I'd very much like to expand on that work by opening the doors of Washington, D.C., to folks working on community activism, like what Barack did in Chicago 20 years ago."Regardless of what happens in November, what are your hopes for our country?"My dream is one that we all share as Americans: to live in a country where all children go to good schools, where we have an economy that rewards hard-working people, and where affordable, quality health care is available for everyone. That is the America that I hope my girls � and all our children � will inherit from us."After Attacks, Michelle Obama Looks for a New IntroductionMichelle Obama�s eyes flicker tentatively even as she offers a trained smile. As her campaign plane arcs over the Flathead Range in Montana, she is asked to consider her complicated public image.Conservative columnists accuse her of being unpatriotic and say she simmers with undigested racial anger. A blogger who supported Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton circulates unfounded claims that Mrs. Obama gave an accusatory speech in her church about the sins of �whitey.� Mrs. Obama shakes her head.�You are amazed sometimes at how deep the lies can be,� she says in an interview. Referring to a character in a 1970s sitcom, she adds: �I mean, �whitey�? That�s something that George Jefferson would say. Anyone who says that doesn�t know me. They don�t know the life I�ve lived. They don�t know anything about me.�Now her husband�s presidential campaign is giving her image a subtle makeover, with a new speech in the works to emphasize her humble roots and a tough new chief of staff. On Wednesday, Mrs. Obama will do a guest turn on �The View,� the daytime talk show on ABC, with an eye toward softening her reputation.Her problems seemed hard to imagine last fall and winter. Mrs. Obama, a Harvard-trained lawyer, appeared so at ease with the tactile business of campaigning and drew praise for humanizing, often with humor, a husband who could seem elusive.Then came some rhetorical stumbles. In Madison, Wis., in February, she told voters that hope was sweeping America, adding, �For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.� Cable news programs replayed those 15 words in an endless loop of outrage.Barack Obama often blurs identity lines; much of his candidacy has seemed almost post-racial. Mrs. Obama�s identity is less mutable. She is a descendant of slaves and a product of Chicago�s historically black South Side. She burns hot where he banks cool, and that too can make her an inviting proxy for attack.Fox News called her �Obama�s baby mama,� a derogatory term for an unwed mother. Christopher Hitchens, a Slate columnist, claimed � with scant evidence � that her college thesis proved she was once influenced by black separatism. National Review presented her as a scowling �Mrs. Grievance.�The caricatures of Mrs. Obama as the Angry Black Woman confound her, friends say. Her own family crosses racial boundaries � her mother-in-law and a sister-in-law are white � and she has spent much of her adult life trying to address racial resentment.In her freshman year at Princeton, a white roommate�s mother agitated for her daughter to swap rooms. Mrs. Obama was among a handful of blacks at a prestigious Chicago law firm. As a hospital executive, she navigated the often tense line between a predominantly white-run institution and a suspicious black community.But the 44-year-old woman known even to friends as The Taskmaster sometimes speaks with a passion unusual for a potential first lady. She tells voters that �Barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual � uninvolved, uninformed.�She says she intends to evoke a John F. Kennedy-like idealism and highlight her own journey, but in her commanding cadences, some people � and not just conservatives � hear a lecture.Before her husband announced his candidacy, Mrs. Obama confided in friends: Barack and I will cut an unfamiliar figure to most of America.�It�s such uncharted waters,� said Verna Williams, a Harvard classmate and friend. �In a sound-bite era, where you have to come with a quick and dirty take, she doesn�t fit what it means to be an African-American woman.�Early Questions on RaceMichelle Robinson grew up in the black half of a divided Chicago. She and her brother, Craig, lived with their parents on the second floor of a bungalow. �Two bedrooms, if you want to be generous,� she says.Her father, Frasier Robinson, was a pump operator for Chicago�s water department and a precinct captain in the Democratic machine. Her mother, Marian, brought workbooks home to keep her children ahead of their classes. The working-class neighborhood was filled with uncles and grandparents, block associations and oak trees. �We knew the gang-bangers � my brother played basketball in the park,� Mrs. Obama says. �Home never feels dangerous.�In 1981, she left for Princeton, an overwhelmingly white institution that cherished its genteel traditions. She was one of 94 black freshmen in a class of over 1,100. Catherine Donnelly, a white student from New Orleans, was a roommate. Her mother spent months pleading with Princeton officials to give her daughter a white roommate instead. �Mom just blew a gasket when I described Michelle,� Ms. Donnelly recalled. �It was my secret shame.�Mrs. Obama shrugs now. Some classmates resented blacks; some resented affirmative action. �Diversity can�t be taken care of with 10 kids,� she says. �There is an isolation that comes with that.�Her brother, two years older, was a star basketball player at Princeton, but he felt similarly. �If you�re young and black and from the South Side, there are always going to be people who feel you should not be there,� Craig Robinson said. �You build up a thick skin.�Black and white students rarely socialized. When Crystal Nix Hines became the first black editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Princetonian, some black students wondered why she wanted to run a �white� newspaper. Mrs. Obama, however, was thrilled that a historic barrier had fallen.That did not stop her, however, from confronting Ms. Hines, a friend, over an article that contained what Mrs. Obama took to be inappropriate characterizations of a black politician. � �You need to make sure that a story like that doesn�t run again,� � Ms. Hines recalls her friend saying with utter calm.Sociology became her lens to examine her anxieties about race. Mrs. Obama spent hours in the office of Professor Marvin Bressler. �She was troubled by the questions that troubled every student in that situation,� he said. �They all walk around saying, �Who am I?� �In her senior thesis, she asked: Does immersion in an elite white institution draw blacks away from their community? She surveyed black Princeton alumni, finding their ties weakened after graduation.�The path I have chosen to follow by attending Princeton,� Mrs. Obama wrote in the introduction, �will likely lead to my further integration and/or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society, never becoming a full participant.�Mitchell Duneier, a sociology professor at Princeton who reviews undergraduate theses, noted that Mrs. Obama rejected some of her own theories. �Her senior thesis is being misread as if it is a polemical essay about her alienation,� Professor Duneier said.Epiphany Leads to HomeMichelle Obama recalls gazing out the window of her plush 47th-floor office in downtown Chicago and realizing that she could barely see, literally or metaphorically, her beloved South Side.After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, Mrs. Obama took a job at what is now Sidley Austin, a corporate law firm. She had a handsome salary and the prospect of better to come.Then a close friend from college died. So did her father, who had long suffered from multiple sclerosis; Michelle so adored him that she would curl up in his lap even as an adult.�I looked out at my neighborhood and sort of had an epiphany that I had to bring my skills to bear in the place that made me,� she says in the interview. �I wanted to have a career motivated by passion and not just money.�Eventually, she started the Chicago chapter of a training program called Public Allies. One day, looking for young leaders, she might knock on doors at Cabrini-Green, a public housing project so violent and neglected it would later be mostly demolished. Another day, she discovered Jose A. Rico, a young Mexican so alienated that he insisted on remaining an illegal immigrant rather than pursue citizenship. What is your goal? he recalled her asking.To open a high school for Latinos, he replied. Mrs. Obama nodded: Good, tell me exactly how you would do it.�Michelle was tough, man; she let nothing slide,� said Mr. Rico, now principal of Multicultural Arts High School in Chicago, which he helped start.She preached the gospel of the second and third chance, insisting that the white youth from Swarthmore work alongside the former gang member.Every Friday, the young people would sprawl around Mrs. Obama�s office, swapping frustrations. When a white college student complained that Mr. Rico took forever to write a simple memorandum, Mr. Rico recalls responding, Who are you to speak, when you babble in pidgin Spanish and act arrogant?Blacks accused whites of being clueless. Whites said blacks masked insecurity with anger. Mrs. Obama probed carefully, sometimes dialing up the heat before turning it down.�I hate diversity workshops,� she says. �Real change comes from having enough comfort to be really honest and say something very uncomfortable.�Mr. Rico is intrigued to see her on television now. �Her style is still to say: �Hey! I�m going to tell you where I stand, and you figure out where you stand,� � he said.By 2001, Mrs. Obama, married for nine years and the mother of two daughters, had taken a job as vice president of community affairs at the University of Chicago Medical Center. She soon discovered just how acrimonious those affairs were.Hospital brass had gathered to break ground for a children�s building when African-American protesters broke in with bullhorns, drowning out the proceedings with demands that the hospital award more contracts to minority firms.The executives froze. Mrs. Obama strolled over and offered to meet later, if only the protestors would pipe down. She revised the contracting system, sending so much business to firms owned by women and other minorities that the hospital won awards.In the mostly black neighborhoods around the hospital, Mrs. Obama became the voice of a historically white institution. Behind closed doors, she tried to assuage their frustrations about a place that could seem forbidding.Like many urban hospitals, the medical center�s emergency room becomes clogged with people who need primary care. So Mrs. Obama trained counselors, mostly local blacks, to hand out referrals to health clinics lest black patients felt they were being shooed away.She also altered the hospital�s research agenda. When the human papillomavirus vaccine, which can prevent cervical cancer, became available, researchers proposed approaching local school principals about enlisting black teenage girls as research subjects.Mrs. Obama stopped that. The prospect of white doctors performing a trial with black teenage girls summoned the specter of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment of the mid-20th century, when white doctors let hundreds of black men go untreated to study the disease.�She�ll talk about the elephant in the room,� said Susan Sher, her boss at the hospital, where Mrs. Obama is on leave from her more-than-$300,000-a-year job.New Role, New ScriptRather than pulling Mrs. Obama behind a curtain, her husband�s campaign is pushing her farther out on stage. She remains a charismatic presence, and when she gives her husband a fist dap or talks of him as a father, she is telling voters, this is a regular guy. This South Side woman anchors him in her reality.In coming weeks, Mrs. Obama will visit the spouses of military personnel and talk of the patriotic duty to provide these families with care and services. And the campaign has hired Stephanie Cutter, a veteran strategist, as her chief of staff, who will seek to deflect attacks.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, a close ally of the Obama campaign, says Mrs. Obama must stop sounding like a lawyer trying to win an argument. The trick, she said, is �not pushing so hard to persuade people that Barack is the right one.��All she has to do is be likable,� Mrs. McCaskill said.Mrs. Obama has already had to check her brutally honest approach to talking about race. Now she co-stars in a campaign that would as soon mute most discussion of race.As her plane descends into a northern Montana valley, she sounds like a woman who wishes she could sit voters down for a long talk. �You know, if someone sat in a room with me for five minutes after hearing these rumors, they�d go �huh?� � she says. �They�d realize it doesn�t make sense.�She extends her long arms, her voice plaintive. �I will walk anyone through my life,� she says. �Come on, let�s go.�Mincing Up MichelleHillary and Bill are busy updating their enemies lists. And Obama is racking his brain trying to figure out where to stash his erstwhile rival.If a President Obama put her on the Supreme Court, of course, we would have the infinite fun of hearing Bill rant about how Scalia, Alito, Thomas and Roberts were dissing Hillary.It�s good news for Obama that Hillary�s out of the race. But it�s also bad news. Now Republicans can turn their full attention to demonizing Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is the new, unwilling contestant in Round Two of the sulfurous national game of �Kill the witch.�There are some who think it will be harder for America to accept a black first lady � the national hostess who serenely presides over the White House Christmas festivities and the Easter egg roll � than a black president.There are creepy Web sites, like TheObamaFile.com, dedicated to painting Michelle as a female version of Jeremiah Wright, an angry black woman, the disgruntled, lecturing �Mrs. Grievance� depicted on the cover of National Review.On that site and others around the Internet, the seamy rumors still slither that there�s a tape of Michelle denouncing �whitey,� a rumor that Barack Obama disdained last week as �scurrilous.�E.D. Hill, the Fox anchor who said that the celebrated fist pump between Michelle and her husband the night he snagged the nomination could be called a �terrorist fist jab,� apologized Tuesday.In their narrative of how Hillary lost in The Times on Sunday, Jim Rutenberg and Peter Baker said that Mark Penn argued that Hillary should subtly stress Obama�s �lack of American roots.�That�s a good preview of how Republicans will attack Michelle, suggesting that she does not share American values, mining a subtext of race.She�s a devoted daughter, wife and mother who has lived the American dream, from the humble South Side of Chicago to Harvard Law School. Hey, isn�t it totally unAmerican to complain that being a black woman in the �80s at a class-conscious, white-bread college, Princeton, was somewhat uncomfortable?Just as Bill and Hillary did the �Pssst! He�s black!� thing on Barry, now the Republicans will use the same tactic on the strong and opinionated Michelle.Unlike her husband, who wrote in his memoir that he had learned at a young age to smile and charm and disarm whites of the notion that he might be a bristly black militant, Michelle has not always hidden her jangly opinions so well. She has spent more time dwelling on the ways in which society can pull down the less privileged and refers a lot to a callous but unnamed �They.��Michelle,� as one political observer puts it, �is a target-rich environment.�Team Obama is hoping for the best. When she�s on her game, after all, Michelle is a knockout. And as one Obama booster enthuses: �Michelle�s story is a lot more mainstream American than Cindy McCain inheriting a brewery.�But the campaign is preparing for the worst, planning to shore up Michelle with her own slick and quick war room staffed by top operatives from previous campaigns.David Axelrod thinks �there�s a real recoil potential� if the Republicans go after Michelle. �I don�t think she�s projecting herself into the fray in a way that would justify that,� he said, adding that her charming and polite daughters, Malia and Sasha, are walking testimony to Michelle�s �loving parenting.�Mike Murphy, the G.O.P. strategist who worked for John McCain in 2000, but not yet this year, said Michelle is heading into her �big moment in the sun.��She�ll have the opportunity to do pretty well and the opportunity to really screw up.� he said. �What I glimpse of her from far away makes me think there could be trouble, but anytime you have that size microphone, she will have some control over how she handles the pressure.�She�s going to take her big microphone on �The View� as a co-host next week, when she will no doubt try to put her remark about her belated pride in her country in context. And she clearly scored a pre-emptive hit both with her chic style � Vogue�s Andr� Leon Talley declared in The Times the dawn of �a black Camelot� � and with her playful fist pump that now has older white guys, like North Carolina Gov. Mike Easley, awkwardly trying to do it with Obama.The dap or pound, as it�s also called, was a natural and beguiling moment that showed the country that, even though she started out as her husband�s boss and has a r�sum� that matches his, she likes him and is rooting for him, and is not engaged in a dreaded Clintonesque competition with him. (On the night of the Pennsylvania primary, Bill was eagerly checking to see who had swayed more voters � him or Hillary.)�She isn�t sitting with a fixed, adoring gaze,� Axelrod said. �But she obviously loves him deeply and believes in him, and more than that, she believes in this. And that motivates him.�Michelle Obama Shows Her Warmer Side on �The View�First, she had to unclench her fist.Michelle Obama�s opening move as a guest co-host of �The View� on Wednesday was to joke about the famous bump that she had given her husband the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, and that was described by the Fox News anchor E.D. Hill as a �terrorist fist jab.� Mrs. Obama said she was not really �that hip� and credited her husband�s campaign workers for the gesture. �I got that from the young staff,� she said. �It�s the new high five.�And in that way, and perhaps only that way, Mrs. Obama looked a little like the wife of her husband�s Republican opponent, Cindy McCain, who also used a co-hosting appearance on �The View� last April to smooth over her campaign kerfuffle.Recipes posted on the McCain campaign Web site as Mrs. McCain�s family�s favorites turned out to be copied word-for-word from ones by Rachael Ray and others. Mrs. McCain told the show�s hosts that an intern had posted the recipes without permission and been duly punished. �That intern is now, I�m happy to say, at the Betty Crocker boot camp,� she joked.The amount of scrutiny the two spouses face is not commensurate � Mrs. Obama has endured far more virulent attacks by her critics � but it is somehow symmetrical. Mrs. Obama went on a popular television talk show to combat the notion that she is a little too authentic to be a first lady, while Mrs. McCain did it to undercut the image that she is too fake.It is a familiar pattern. Democratic candidates� wives � from Rosalynn Carter and Kitty Dukakis to Hillary Rodham Clinton and Teresa Heinz Kerry � are almost invariably characterized by opponents as too feisty and too outspoken, a little too radical for mainstream America. Betty Ford was an early exception to the Republican rule of bland, self-effacing homemakers; as the Equal Rights Amendment faded as a cause and conservatism made a comeback, Republican spouses became ever more careful to stay three steps behind their men and the times. And some have become so intent that they are accused of playacting.In this election, the two candidates� wives could not be more different, but each is haunted by the legacy of a famous predecessor. Mrs. McCain, who is very rich, very thin and exquisitely dressed and carries herself with Bergdorf Goodman hauteur, is not at all like Laura Bush or Barbara Bush; she is a blond version of Nancy Reagan circa 1980.Early on, Mrs. Obama was likened to Jackie Kennedy for her youth and fashion style, but lately, the strong and assertive African-American career woman is experiencing the kind of antifeminist hazing that Mrs. Clinton endured in the 1992 campaign when she made her �baking cookies� faux pas.Mrs. Obama distanced herself from that model on �The View,� describing herself as a mother and not mentioning her law career or her views on policy. But she also made a point of framing Mrs. Clinton as a pioneer, asserting that sexism had been an issue in her bid for the presidential nomination and praising her gumption.�It�s only when women like her take the hits and it�s painful, it�s hurtful, but she� s taking them so that my girls, when they come along, won�t have to feel it as badly,� Mrs. Obama said.Her performance on Wednesday was polished and all but flawless � although she did almost slip when she tried to describe her husband�s easygoing personality and said what some in the audience heard as �sweet and pathetic.� As her co-hosts giggled, Mrs. Obama demurred that she had meant �sweet, empathetic.�And she dealt � once again � with the issue of patriotism, explaining that when she had said during the primary that this was the first time she felt �really proud� of her country, she was referring to the political process, not the nation.�Of course I am proud of my country,� she said. �Nowhere but in America could my story be possible.�Mrs. Obama made a point of showing her warmer, more personable side, talking about her working-class parents and the joys of being the mother of two young girls, and even admitting that she serves bacon for breakfast and does not wear pantyhose, but she did not disguise her confident manner or her natural authority. Nor did she ever truly relax. When asked whether the reaction to some of her comments had led her to be more inhibited, Mrs. Obama replied somewhat stiffly, �I think in this media age I have to be cognizant.�And Mrs. Obama seems very aware of how the news media work. As if to send a veiled message to Mrs. McCain, Mrs. Obama mentioned how grateful she was to Laura Bush, noting that she had sent the first lady a note thanking her for her sympathy after her �first time� remarks backfired.Mrs. McCain, at the time, had been uncharacteristically outspoken and combative, telling Republican audiences: � I�m proud of my country. I don�t know about you � if you heard those words earlier � I�m very proud of my country.�Mrs. Obama said she was taking some cues from Mrs. Bush. �There�s a reason people like her,� Mrs. Obama said. �It�s because she doesn�t, sort of, you know, add fuel to the fire.�This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: June 27, 2008The TV Watch column on June 19, about Michelle Obama�s appearance as a co-host on �The View,� referred incorrectly to her mention of her gratitude to Laura Bush after Mrs. Obama was criticized for saying she was really proud of her country for the first time and Mrs. Bush sympathized with her. Mrs. Obama said that she had sent a note to Mrs. Bush, not that Mrs. Bush had sent a note to her.Michelle Obama Stresses Barack's American ValuesMichelle Obama painted an intimate portrait of her husband, Barack Obama, as a father and family man with faith in the American dream Monday night.Her comments came during a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver aimed at reassuring voters that her husband shares the values of ordinary Americans and is ready to lead the nation.Michelle said that she and Barack believed "that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them."She described her own blue-collar upbringing in Chicago and how hard her parents worked to raise a family. And she emphasized that though her husband had "grown up all the way across the continent," he had a similar life and the same values.She told the cheering delegates that her husband would be "an extraordinary president." "Barack will finally bring the change we need," she said.Dismissing questions about her patriotism, Obama said, "I love this country" � a rebuttal to criticism after remarks earlier this year when she said she felt proud of America for the first time.After the speech, the Obamas' two daughters joined their mother on the podium, and Barack Obama appeared via satellite from Kansas City."How about Michelle Obama?" he asked the crowd. "Now you know why I asked her out so many times, even though she said no. You want a persistent president." The girls responded to their father on the giant screen with "Hi, Daddy!" and "I love you, Daddy."Kennedy Stirs Party FaithfulEarlier in the night, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, 76, battling a malignant brain tumor, nonetheless appeared hearty and robust in an unscheduled appearance. He told delegates, many of whom waved Kennedy signs above their heads, that "The work begins anew, the hope rises again and the dream lives on," a reprise of a famous speech he delivered at the Democrats' 1980 convention."I have come here tonight to stand with you, to change America, to restore its future, to rise to our best ideals and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States," Kennedy said.He also pledged to be back in the U.S. Senate come January, when Democrats hope Obama will be inaugurated president.McCain A TargetThe convention formally began earlier in the day, and speakers wasted no time in attacking the presumptive Republican nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain.Texas Rep. Silvestre Reyes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told delegates that "America cannot afford a third Bush-Cheney term, which is what a McCain presidency would be."Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. said America needs "a leader who can heal the wounds of the last eight years, a leader who knows that what unites us is greater than what divides us."Still, the continuing squabbles between the Obama campaign and supporters of the rival he narrowly defeated, Hillary Clinton, threatened to reopen wounds in the Democratic Party.Grumbling Among Clinton BackersThe convention got under way as polls show many supporters of Clinton still unsure about throwing their support behind Obama. In a news conference earlier in the day, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the convention co-chair, admonished reporters for focusing on the conflict between the Obama campaign and Clinton supporters."This is like a yesterday room," Pelosi said. "The nomination is decided. We have a vice president. We will work together to go forward. Every convention has its areas of disagreement. To stay wallowing in all of this is not productive."One remaining issue to be settled is Wednesday night's scheduled roll call of the states. Pelosi said she was against suggestions that it be called off in order to avoid a raucous pro-Clinton demonstration the night before Obama is to accept the party's nomination.The Obama campaign was reportedly considering allowing the roll call to proceed, but ending it after the New York delegation announced its count. That would presumably allow the "catharsis" that Clinton says her supporters deserve, yet reinforce the fact that this is Obama's convention.Party MessageThe dispute over Clinton's supporters threatened to detract from the message that Democrats hope to project to voters over the next four days: that of a unified party eager to point out the differences between Obama and McCain.Many in the long roster of Democratic convention speakers pointed to the nation's economic woes, as reflected in high energy prices and a housing crisis."President Bush has run our economy into the ground," asserted New York Rep. Jose Serrano. "Our families cannot afford four more years of stagnation and failure."Delegates adopted the party's 2008 platform in one of the convention's first official acts. It calls for ending the war in Iraq responsibly; immigration reform that is both "tough" and "humane"; and planks on faith and fatherhood, a favorite theme of Obama's.McCain Defends HomesMeanwhile, McCain, who accepts the Republican presidential nomination next week, was not willing to cede the spotlight to Obama entirely. In an appearance on NBC's Tonight Show, McCain defended himself from criticism that he did not know how many homes his family owns.McCain, harking back to his time as a POW in Vietnam, told host Jay Leno that during the 5 1/2 years he spent in a prison cell, "I didn't have a house, I didn't have a kitchen table, I didn't have a table, I didn't have a chair." He added, "I spent those 5 1/2 years ... not because I wanted to get a house when I got out."Michelle Obama celebrates Chicago rootsDENVER -- It was about family. And Chicago.The first day of the Democratic National Convention on Monday featured Michelle Obama talking about her family and saying "That is why I love this country."It was obviously designed as an answer to Republicans who have tried to portray her as unpatriotic, quoting a line in a speech in which Michelle Obama said her husband's run for the president was "the first time" she could be proud of her country.But Monday was also orchestrated to show the softer side of the South Side woman who could become the nation's first African-American first lady.As with the roll-out of running mate Joe Biden on Saturday, the emphasis was all on family and working-class roots. And on Monday, it was also about presenting Michelle Obama as the girl next door."I come here as a daughter -- raised on the South Side of Chicago by a father who was a blue-collar city worker, and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me," Obama told an enthusiastic crowd waving vertical blue "Michelle" banners.Closing the first night of the convention, her speech also aimed to present her husband as a common man with family experiences voters can relate to."The Barack Obama I know today is the same man I fell in love with 19 years ago," she said, her voice thick with emotion."He's the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer, inching along at a snail's pace, peering at us anxiously in the rearview mirror, feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands, determined to give her everything he'd struggled so hard for himself, determined to give her something he never had: the affirming embrace of a father's love," she said.Michelle Obama was introduced by a video presentation featuring her mother, then a live introduction from her brother, Craig Robinson, who evaluated his sister's suitor by playing basketball with him when Obama first started dating Michelle.Robinson talked about conversations with his sister late into the night growing up."When I wasn't happy doing what I was doing -- investment banking -- she was the one who encouraged me to go back to my first love, teaching and coaching," he said to cheers.The afternoon and evening of speeches also showcased Obama's broader Chicago political family and friends.Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan watched as his daughter, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, talked about eating sandwiches with Obama on the state Senate floor. One row up in the Illinois delegation, former state Senate President Tom Hynes watched as his son, state Comptroller Dan Hynes, spoke of being the first elected official in the nation to call on Obama to run for president.The night's finale belonged to the youngest Obamas.As Michelle Obama finished speaking and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, came out on stage, Barack Obama's live image appeared on-screen behind them praising his wife's performance."Love you Daddy!" his daughters shouted.The trio of young Illinois presumptive rising stars who spoke Monday -- all of them toying with the idea of running for governor -- closed with Treasurer Alexei Giannoulias. Another second-generation familiar name, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., won a covetted prime-time spot.Obama�s mentor, State Senate President Emil Jones; Chicago City Clerk Miguel Del Valle; and the man who brought Obama to Chicago, Jerry Kellman, also spoke,The younger Jackson explained how Obama won over voters of different backgrounds all over Illinois to win his senate seat four years ago and he said Obama�s election as president could fulfill Martin Luther King Jr.�s dream.�Forty-five years to the day after a young preacher called out, �Let freedom ring,�� Jackson said. �Let history show in this fourth week of August in this Mile-High City, freedom in America has never rung from a higher mountaintop than it does here today.�Giannoulias said he was Obama�s basketball buddy -- Obama considers it good luck to play basketball with Giannoulias on election mornings.�My parents came to this country as Greek immigrants with nothing,� Giannoulias said. �But whether your story begins in a small Greek village, or the plains of Kansas, or on the streets of Chicago, we're Americans because we all share the promise of that story.�Michelle Obama�s High NoteFinally, some good reviews. A sampling of the instant reactions to Michelle Obama�s speech (and Barack Obama�s appearance on a giant TV screen) in blogland:-The American Prospect�s Ezra Klein loved Mrs. Obama�s �beautifully delivered, and smartly crafted, speech.� He writes, �She�s also coming off as wholesome and, frankly, familiar.� But he�s less sure about �Giant Screen Obama�: �I can�t decide if the faux-intimacy of Daddy tele-parenting in the middle of the convention was a bit too precious,� Klein writes, later adding, �On the other hand, I�m a cynical, coastal elite type and could just be insufficiently appreciative of camp.�-Kathryn Jean Lopez of National Review did, too: �Michelle and the girls were a homerun for Dems tonight,� she writes at The Corner. �It�s no small thing when both sides can talk American exceptionalism. It�s a start.�-The New Republic�s Katherine Marsh probably didn�t, however. �I miss the old Michelle, and I think a lot of other women do, too,� Marsh writes. �Not the scripted Stepford wife fist-bumping Elisabeth Hasselbeck, but the sassy better half who reminded us that while Barack was the answer, he was also stinky in the morning and forgot to put the butter away. She both affirmed his promise and humanized him.� Marsh continues:You could actually imagine their relationship was a real thing�not a symbiotic power alliance, but a union of two different people with different goals who just happen, when they�re not bickering about the butter, to find each other pretty cool. This Michelle was an asset to the campaign, a highly accomplished woman outside the sphere of motherhood as well as in it, a necessary bit of fire to Obama�s dispassionate ice, and valuable proof that Obama isn�t the type of guy inclined to surround himself�like our current president�with yes-men or -women. If Joe Biden can be forgiven his sins and welcomed onto the stage beside the African American nominee he once called clean and articulate, then surely Michelle Obama can finally be freed from the clutches of US Weekly and Joy Behar and allowed to give a speech that truly reflects who she is.-Neither did The New Republic�s Jason Zengerle. �Michelle Obama introduced herself as a sister, a wife, a mother, and a daughter�which are all incredibly important identities,� he writes at The Plank, his magazine�s staff blog. �But those identities don�t reveal her full person�the Princeton and Harvard Law grad, the corporate attorney, the hospital executive�which were parts of her life that she barely mentioned.� Zengerle later adds, �It almost makes you long for the days when politicians� wives were seen but not heard. After all, if they�re not permitted to really say anything, what�s the point of having them speak?�-Andrew Sullivan, however, is no longer cranky: �One of the best, most moving, intimate, rousing, humble, and beautiful speeches I�ve heard from a convention platform. Maybe she should be running for president.�Michelle Obama Dismisses CriticismsMichelle Obama is turning the other cheek to the sharp attacks on her husband, Senator Barack Obama, from Senator John McCain, his wife, Cindy, and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin.In two televised interviews Wednesday night, Mrs. Obama expressed nothing but kindness toward the Republican ticket. She even offered praise for Ms. Palin, saying she provided �an excellent example� of how women can juggle work and family.�You know, I�m a mother with kids and I�ve had a career and I�ve had to juggle,� Mrs. Obama said on CNN�s �Larry King Live.��She�s doing publicly what so many women are doing on their own privately,� she added. �What we�re fighting for is to make sure that all women have the choices that Sarah Palin and I have.�Mr. King was trying to get a rise out of Mrs. Obama, bringing up several criticisms of her husband, but she deflected most of them, both with Mr. King and on Comedy Central�s �Daily Show� with Jon Stewart.Instead, she took a decidedly non-partisan approach as she offered reassurances about her husband � and herself � and sought to court voters, especially working-class women and independents, who may be attracted to Ms. Palin.�Most people really want to find solutions,� she told Mr. Stewart. �And they want leaders who are going to unite us around a set of solutions that are going to make sense.�She told Mr. King that she harbored no ill will toward Ms. Palin for saying recently that Mr. Obama was �someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country,� a reference to Bill Ayers, the 1960s radical.Mr. King asked whether she knew Mr. Ayers. �I don�t know anyone in Chicago who�s heavily involved in education policy who doesn�t know Bill Ayers,� Mrs. Obama said.But, she hastened to add � and this was her central message of the evening � the back and forth of the campaign is not of interest to voters, who care more about jobs and the economy.Besides, Mrs. Obama told Mr. King, she and her husband don�t see the negative ads because she is too busy to watch TV and when her husband watches, he tunes into sports.She made the same point with Mr. Stewart, to more amusing effect.When she said she had �stopped reading and watching a lot of stuff,� Mr. Stewart put in: �So, you�re a lot like Sarah Palin?�The line got a big laugh and applause.�Perhaps,� Mrs. Obama said. (She said that sometimes she is relieved not to be campaigning so she can watch �The Dick Van Dyke Show.�)Mr. Stewart asked her if, when Ms. Palin asks voters who is the real Barack Obama, she doesn�t want to ask back, �Who are you?��That does cross your mind,� Mrs. Obama allowed, but she added that Mr. Obama had been vetted for 20 months and was in a tough primary and said that if something bad was there, it would have come out by now.On Larry King, she brushed off Mr. McCain�s reference during Tuesday�s debate to her husband as �that one.� And she said that she had a respectful relationship with Mrs. McCain, even though Mrs. McCain had said on Tuesday that that Mr. Obama had waged �the dirtiest campaign in American history.�No matter who wins the election, Mrs. Obama said, there should be no hard feelings.�You can�t tear up the game so much so that, you know, you don�t leave people something to come back to,� she said. �You know, we�re going to need John McCain, we�re going to need Cindy McCain, we�re going to need independents and Republicans working hard to fix this crisis.�Mrs. Obama also dismissed a suggestion from Mr. King that voters might vote against her husband on racial grounds. She said she did not believe in the so-called Bradley effect, which occurred in 1982, when voters told pollsters they would vote for Tom Bradley, a black man, for governor of California but then did not do so.�If there was going to be a Bradley effect,� she said, Mr. Obama would not have won the nomination. Besides, she said, the Bradley episode was �several decades ago, and there�s been growth and movement.��Now, there will be people who will never vote for Barack Obama,� she said. �But there will be people who will never vote for John McCain either.�She added: �I just believe that the issues are going to weigh in people�s hearts more so as they go into the voting booths this time around, than anything else.�She also told a story about telling her 10-year-old daughter, Malia, that it was an historic moment when Mr. Obama won the nomination because he was the first African-American to do so.�And Malia said, �Well, yes, you know, I realize what a big deal it is,� she said, �but it would have been a big deal if Hillary Clinton had won too,� � Mrs. Obama said. �She said it without blinking an eye. She said, �Because women didn�t have the right to vote and there was inequality there.� It was a matter-of-fact.�She added that Mrs. Clinton had been �phenomenal� to her, had provided advice and was �a real pro and a woman with character.�On Comedy Central, Mr. Stewart noted that the role of First Lady was becoming almost like an elected office itself, as the spouses were being vetted as much as the candidates.Mrs. Obama attributed that to the 24-hour news cycle, where the media says: �Now we know what the candidates are like, where can we go next? Let�s take a look at their wives and their houses and their � all of that good stuff.�She added: �I think it�s fair because we�re in there, you know, and it�s important for people to � they need to have a comfort level with me as well as with Cindy McCain.�Mr. Stewart, continuing with his theme about the First Lady being an elective office, said how weird it would be if Mr. Obama were elected but then if Mrs. McCain were elected too. �She has to move in, and that�s tough,� Mr. Stewart said.Mrs. Obama agreed. �We don�t want that to happen,� she said.Michelle: Barack's bitter or better half?It is less than a month into the general election and Michelle Obama is already in the midst of a makeover.Michelle ObamaMichelle Obama could help court the all-important female voteA tough primary campaign put some dents in her image. She weathered a storm of criticism following a comment she made about her husband's candidacy, saying that "for the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change".Immediately, Republicans and her Democratic rivals piled in, including Republican presidential hopeful John McCain's wife Cindy McCain, who has alluded to Mrs Obama's comment on more than one occasion.The conservative magazine National Review dubbed her "Mrs Grievance." Conservative commentators have called her Barack Obama's "bitter half." Fox News was rebuked for referring to her with the racial slander "Baby Mama," and talk among political pundits escalated about her "angry" side.The politically motivated rumour mills that have plagued Mr Obama have not spared Mrs Obama either. Whisper campaigns on the internet have alluded to racist comments in her past that she says she has never made (and the evidence is solidly in her court, as so far no one has produced any evidence of the comments).True to herselfStill, the Obama campaign is actively trying to refresh Mrs Obama's image. Appearing on ABC's The View last week, Mrs Obama used the opportunity to address her critics, but also to present a picture that those close to her say is more true to herself than the caricature her critics are painting.Michelle Obama on The ViewMichelle with her jokey "fist bump" on The ViewDuring the course of the show she was able to talk about her background, growing up in humble circumstances on the South Side of Chicago, attending Princeton for college, and Harvard law school, becoming a wife and a mother.She addressed her "proud" gaffe directly, saying "I think when I talked about it during my speech, what I was talking about was having a part in the political process. People are just engaged in this election in a way that I haven't seen in a long time and I think everybody has agreed with that, that people are focused, they're coming out."She also appeared this week on the cover of US Weekly Magazine above the title Why Barack Loves Her. The article pointed out that she shops at the US store Target, loved the television show Sex and the City, and included a quote from Mr Obama, who told the magazine, "Nothing is more important to Michelle than being a good mother."It is no surprise that the Obama campaign chose The View and US Weekly for their re-introduction of Mrs Obama; those outlets are extremely popular among women, who are up for grabs in this election.Hillary Clinton's loss in the Democratic primary, combined with Republican competition for important female demographics including married and Hispanic women, makes winning women all the more important for Mr Obama.Modest rootsMrs Obama could be quite an asset when appealing to these voters.Her background is another electoral asset. Her roots on Chicago's historically black South Side and the fact that she is a descendant of American slaves served as an important counter-point to early questions among African American voters over whether Mr Obama is "black enough."Barack ObamaMichelle could provide a counterpoint to Barack who is more guardedHer conversations with African Americans about her background and the fact that she has family from South Carolina were a key piece of the Obama primary strategy in the state, and contributed to Mr Obama's win there.She is also well-positioned as a bold counterpoint to the GOP's favourite charge when it comes to Mr Obama: "elitism". Her modest roots in a one-bedroom apartment, with a shift-working father, are anything but "elite".Further, as she said herself on last week's The View, she "wears her heart on her sleeve," a potentially powerful contrast to Mr Obama, who, at times, has come across as more guarded.She is able to speak for the candidate in a way that no one else can. Mrs Obama has talked about what her husband was like as a younger man, the qualities that she loves about him and the reasons she thinks he should be president.All this is in the hope that voters can connect to her stories, and increase their trust in him. If she can do that, she will be enormously successful in her role.The downside to all of this, as the Obama campaign is all too aware, is that she runs the risk of being an enormous liability. If rumours about Mrs Obama being anti-white or unpatriotic persist, they could have a very negative impact on Mr Obama's chance to win the White House.Not only do these stories steal the spotlight from the message that the campaign is trying to convey, but they contribute to voters' doubts about Mr Obama.Whether true or completely unfounded, as many of these rumours are, they have a danger of becoming a distraction, and chipping away at Mr Obama's trustworthiness rating, which would, in turn, diminish his ability to win the White House.At the end of the day, voters vote for the candidate they most want to be president of the United States, and not for his wife. But in the months between now and election day, Michelle Obama can have a huge impact on how voters feel on 4 November.First Lady Michelle ObamaWhen people ask First Lady Michelle Obama to describe herself, she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha's mom.But before she was a mother � or a wife, lawyer, or public servant � she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter.The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons.A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life.After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service.In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed.Mrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as First Lady.In 2010, she launched Let�s Move!, bringing together community leaders, educators, medical professionals, parents, and others in a nationwide effort to address the challenge of childhood obesity. Let�s Move! has an ambitious goal: to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. Whether it's providing healthier food in our schools, helping kids be more physically active, or urging companies to market healthier foods to our children, Let�s Move! is focused on giving parents the support they need to make healthier choices for their kids.In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities. Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives.In 2014, Mrs. Obama launched the Reach Higher Initiative, an effort to inspire young people across America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. Reach Higher aims to ensure that all students understand what they need to complete their education by working to expose students to college and career opportunities; helping them understand financial aid eligibility; encouraging academic planning and summer learning opportunities; and supporting high school counselors who do essential work to help students get into college.As First Lady, Mrs. Obama looks forward to continuing her work on the issues close to her heart � supporting military families, helping children lead healthier lives, and encouraging all our young people to fulfill their boundless promise.Michelle and Barack Obama have two daughters: Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13. Like their mother, the girls were born on the South Side of Chicago.Michelle Obama a �feminist nightmare�? Please.When Lyndon B. Johnson became president, he brought with him a new first lady. Lady Bird Johnson�s passion was beautification. It was dismissed by some as a silly project, just planting daffodils by the side of the road.But it was more.Lady Bird was one of the first environmentalists, one with access to the legislative resources of the powerful Johnson White House. She gathered experts and brought the issue of conservation to the nation�s attention. Her work led to the passage of 50 bills protecting national parks and removing billboards and junkyards from the highways. Her work was more than just wildflowers.I was reminded of the inability of some commentators to see the real work of first ladies this week when I read a piece in POLITICO Magazine, calling first lady Michelle Obama a �feminist nightmare.� And that�s why my letter this week is to the Washington reporter who wrote that story, Michelle Cottle.Dear Michelle Cottle,Are you serious?You�or your handful of �feminist� sources�claim that first lady Obama is not a feminist because she says her most important job is being �mom-in-chief� to her two daughters.In a week when right-wing hatred of the president forced a nuclear change in the very rules of the Senate, your advice to the first lady is to come roaring out of the White House battling for reproductive rights?You wring your hands about first lady Obama�s quote �safely and soothingly domestic� issues. You quote a feminist who �marvels that someone of the first lady�s �capacities and education has done so little of substance.�?�Given how simplistic your piece is, let me make this very simple: you are wrong.You�re wrong to write off the first lady�s priorities as fluff. She is fighting childhood obesity, one of the biggest public health crises of our time. And she�s not out there just flexing her biceps and mom-dancing with Jimmy Fallon�her Let�s Move campaign has helped thousands of child care programs offer healthier food and more exercise. And for the first time in years the CDC says there�s a significant decline in obesity in pre-schoolers.The first lady is not playing it safe with this work. She has drawn plenty of right-wing criticism. No, Ms. Cottle, not everyone loves a vegetable garden.You also dismiss the first lady�s new effort to get more low-income students into higher education by saying it�s not �exactly climbing out on a political limb.� But a college degree has everything to do with economic mobility and who gets to be in the middle class, and right now only about a third of students in the poorest families go to college. And only about a tenth graduate.The president has been ridiculed as an elitist for suggesting that more people go to college. So if you think there�s no political risk, maybe you haven�t been paying attention. Also, you misunderstand the place Michelle Obama occupies as the first African-American first lady. You seem to think she is steering clear of the �Angry Black Woman� stereotype.But when she calls herself mom-in-chief, she is rejecting a different stereotype�the role of Mammy. She is saying that her daughters�her vulnerable, brilliant, beautiful black daughters�are the most important thing to her. The first lady is saying, �You, Miss Ann, will have to clean your own house, because I will be caring for my own.� Instead of agreeing that the public sphere is more imporant than Sasha and Malia, she buried Mammy and embraced being a mom on her own terms.So that can be your feminist nightmare, but it is my black motherhood dream.And on a strategic note, Miss Cottle: before we enter the 2016 election cycle and the feminists come asking black women for our support for your candidate, you might want to read up a bit on black women and our feminism. I can send you a syllabus!Sincerely,MelissaEvolution of the Draft and Lottery1947-65: Territorial PicksIn the league's early years, when teams were struggling to include fan bases, the draft included territorial picks. Before the start of the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round pick and instead select a player from its immediate area, presumably with a strong local following.In 1956, the Celtics used a territorial pick to select Tom Heinsohn from Holy Cross in nearby Worcester, Mass. He went on to average 18.6 points and 8.8 rebounds, helping the Celtics to eight NBA championships in his nine-year career.Johnson1966-84: Coin FlipIn 1966, the league adopted a coin flip between the last-place finishers in each of its two divisions to determine which team would open the draft, a system that remained in place until the first lottery in 1985. The remaining teams picked in inverse order of their won-lost records.In 1979, the 31-51 Chicago Bulls called "heads" and the coin came up "tails," thereby giving the first pick to the 26-56 New Orleans Jazz. But the Jazz had to compensate the Lakers for having signed Los Angeles free agent Gail Goodrich and did so with three draft picks, including New Orleans' first round pick in 1979. This became the No. 1 pick after the coin toss, which in turn became Magic Johnson out of Michigan State.The next season, led by their rookie guard, the Lakers became NBA champions for the second time since moving to Los Angeles. Oh yes, and the New Orleans Jazz became the Utah Jazz.Ewing1985: The First LotteryUnder the system adopted prior to the 1985 NBA Draft, the NBA Lottery determined the order of selection for the non-playoff teams (or the teams holding their picks through trades) for the first round only. Teams picked in inverse order of their records in the second round in all succeeding rounds.In 1985, the jackpot of the very first NBA draft lottery was 7-0 Georgetown center Patrick Ewing. All seven teams that didn't make the playoffs had an equal chance of landing the No.1 pick and thereby, Ewing. A lucky bounce of the ping pong balls made the New York Knicks the first draft lottery winner and then-general manager (and Hall of Famer) Dave DeBusschere rose from his seat with a celebratory fist pump.New York selected Ewing with the first overall pick in the 1985 draft and Ewing went on to play 15 seasons for the Knicks, leading them to the playoffs 13 times.Manning1987-Present: Top Three TeamsUnder a procedural change adopted by the Board of Governors in October of 1986, the Lottery determined the order of selection for the first three teams only. The remaining non-playoff teams selected in inverse order of their regular season records. Therefore, the team with the worst record in the league was assured of picking no worse than fourth, the team with the second-worst record no worse than fifth and so on.In 1987, the Clippers finished with a league-worst 12-70 record, but didn't strike it lucky in the lottery and under the new rules, wound up with the fourth pick. The Spurs, who had the fourth-worst record at 28-54 struck gold with Navy center David Robinson at No. 1. Only one of the three worst teams that year wound up with one of the top three picks -- New Jersey, which picked Ohio State guard Dennis Hopson.In 1988, again only one of the three worst teams wound up with one of the top three picks, but at least this time, the Clippers' lowest winning percentage paid off and L.A. won the draft lottery. The Clippers used the No. 1 pick on Kansas forward Danny Manning.Rodman1989-Present: Just Two RoundsIn the early years of the draft, teams would select players until they ran out of prospects. The 1960 draft went 21 rounds. By 1974, it had stabilized to 10 rounds, which held up until 1985, when the draft was shortened to seven rounds. By agreement with the National Basketball Players' Association, the drafts from 1989 onward have been limited to two rounds, which gives undrafted players the chance to try out for any team.Since the draft went to two rounds, eight second-round picks have gone on to become All-Stars: Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek (1992), Pistons forward Dennis Rodman (1992), Lakers guard Cedric Ceballos (1995), Raptors center Antonio Davis (2001), Bucks guard Michael Redd (2004), Wizards guard Gilbert Arenas (2005), Spurs guard Manu Ginobili (2005) and Sonics forward Rashard Lewis (2005). In 2003, Detroit's Ben Wallace and Indiana's Brad Miller became the first undrafted players to make the All-Star team.O'Neal1990-Present: Weighted Lottery SystemIn a further refinement in October of 1989, the Board of Governors adopted a weighted system beginning with the 1990 NBA Draft Lottery, which included 11 teams due to expansion. The team with the worst record during the regular season received 11 chances at the top pick (out of a total of 66), the second-worst team got 10 chances and the team with the best record among the non-playoff clubs got one chance.The Magic defied the new lottery odds by winning the No. 1 pick two years in a row. In 1992, the weighted system worked in their favor as they parlayed the second-worst record (21-61) into LSU center Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal helped Orlando make a 20-win improvement and the Magic just missed the playoffs at .500 in 1993. With just one chance out of 66, the Magic scored the No. 1 pick yet again and selected Michigan forward Chris Webber, trading him immediately to the Warriors for the draft rights to the No. 3 pick, Memphis guard Penny Hardaway and three future draft picks.The Board of Governors approved a modification of the Lottery system in November of 1993 that, effective with the 1994 NBA Draft Lottery, increased the chances of the teams with the worst records in the league winning one of the top three picks in the draft while decreasing the lottery chances of the teams with the best records. The new system increased the chances of the team with the worst record drawing the first pick in the draft from 16.7 percent to 25 percent, while decreasing the chances of the team with the best record among lottery teams from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent.Under the system, 14 ping-pong balls numbered 1 through 14 are placed in a drum. There are 1,001 possible combinations when four balls are drawn out of 14, without regard to their order of selection. Prior to the Lottery, 1,000 combinations are assigned to the Lottery teams based on their order of finish during the regular season. Four balls are drawn to the top to determine a four-digit combination. The team that has been assigned that combination will receive the number one pick. The four balls are placed back in the drum and the process is repeated to determine the number two and three picks. (Note: If the one unassigned combination is drawn, the balls are drawn to the top again.)1996-2003: 13-team LotteryIn October of 1995, the Board of Governors increased the number of teams participating in the Lottery from 11 to 13 to account for the addition of expansion teams Toronto and Vancouver. Starting in 1996, the team with the worst record in the Lottery continued to have a 25% chance (250 combinations) of winning the first pick, teams two (20%; 200 combinations) through six (6.4%; 64 combinations) have slightly fewer chances, team seven (4.4%; 44 combinations) has the same number of chances and teams eight (2.9%; 29 combinations) through 12 (0.6%; six combinations) have slightly more chances. The number of chances for team 13 (0.5%; five combinations) did not change. Tied teams split the number of chances and a blind draw determines which team receives an extra chance if the combined number of chances can not be split evenly.2004-Present: 14-team LotteryThe 2004 NBA Draft Lottery increased to 14 teams with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats. Although a part of the 2004 Draft Lottery the Bobcats are locked into the fourth position in the Draft and therefore do not have a chance to receive other picks in the Lottery. The 2004 NBA Draft Lottery essentially decides picks one through three and four through 14.Wenger backs non-English line-upArsenal manager Arsene Wenger has defended his decision to field an entire squad without an English player in the 5-1 win against Crystal Palace.Wenger fielded the first foreign 16-man squad in English football history because Ashley Cole was ill and Sol Campbell was out injured.Wenger said: "I didn't know about that until I was told about it."I don't look at the passport of people, I look at their quality and their attitude."Wenger joked: "England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson was here, so who did he watch then? Has he signed for a different country?"In reality, Wenger had few alternatives, given that Justin Hoyte was injured and Jermaine Pennant is on loan at Birmingham.At the moment the English aren't good enough and therefore aren't playing, simple as thatFrom CE GoonerHave your say on 606Ryan Smith is still a teenage prospect and Stuart Taylor is the third-choice goalkeeper.But it still confirmed that many of the club's exciting youngsters having been recruited from abroad.Their 16-man squad against Palace featured six Frenchmen, three Spaniards, two Dutchmen, one Cameroon international, one German, one Ivory Coast international, one Brazilian and one Swiss national.Even when Chelsea fielded the first overseas line-up in English football at Southampton on Boxing Day 1999, there were still four young English players on the bench - Jody Morris, Jon Harley, John Terry and Mark Nicholls.At Arsenal, meanwhile, only Cole has come through the ranks to become a first-team regular in recent seasons, although Matthew Upson has played for England since moving to Birmingham.Where the Premier League's players come fromIn the past two decades, the composition of England's top-flight teams has changed dramatically.At the start of the 1989-90 season, leading clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United boasted just one or two regular first-team players who were born outside the United Kingdom.Now, Premier League teams have, on average, 13 foreign-born stars within their ranks.Use the interactive world map above to explore the birthplaces of players in all the current Premier League squads, and compare them with the same teams' players from the start of the 1989-90 season - then find out more about each team below.Twenty years ago, defending champions Arsenal had just two players born outside the UK on their books: Icelandic midfielder Sigurdur Jonsson and Irish forward Niall Quinn.Jonsson made barely a handful of appearances before leaving Highbury in 1992, while Quinn was soon to sign for Manchester City.Liverpool, eventual title-winners that season, had an unusually large number of foreign-born players in their 1989-90 squad.Kenny Dalglish's side featured five players born outside the UK: John Barnes (Jamaica), Bruce Grobbelaar (South Africa), Glenn Hysen (Sweden), Jan Molby (Denmark) and Steve Staunton (Republic of Ireland).But they were the exception. Teams were far more likely to boast just one or two players born outside the UK and, in many cases (such as Manchester City's David Oldfield and Chelsea's Tony Dorigo), those players were British nationals who happened to have been born abroad.Two decades ago, the teams making up this year's Premier League could only boast 12 players born outside the Commonwealth between them.Twenty years later, more than half of the Premier League's clubs could field an entire starting line-up of foreign-born players.Liverpool now have just three UK-born first-team stars in Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson, with other British talents like Jay Spearing making only occasional European appearances to date.Anfield is home to 20 foreign-born players with a strong first-team claim, while Arsenal can boast 23, as opposed to four Brits, all aged under 21.Teams recently promoted to the top flight have the fewest foreign-born players in their first-team squads - Burnley have seven, Wolves have eight, as do Stoke, who gained promotion a year earlier, while Birmingham have nine.West Ham are also at the lower end of the spectrum, with nine foreign-born players, but at the time of writing this still comprised almost half of the 21 first-team players at Gianfranco Zola's disposal.You can find out more about your team below. Remember that the data focuses on place of birth, not nationality.ARSENAL1989-90: 19 players born in UK, two born abroad2009-10: Four players born in UK, 23 born abroadJack WilshereJack Wilshere is one of Arsenal's UK-born youngstersJonsson and Quinn, mentioned above, were as exotic as it got for the Gunners 20 years ago.Arsenal could almost have put out a starting line-up featuring only players born in the London area.By contrast, in February 2005, manager Arsene Wenger became the first in English football to field a matchday squad lacking any English players.The current squad's UK-born talents - Theo Walcott, Aaron Ramsey, Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere - are all under 21 years old.Points on the map2009-10: Carlos Vela, who waited more than three years for his first Arsenal goal (and two of those waiting for a work permit), is Mexican.

in West Africa, with no fewer than four players hailing from Senegal.Back in 1989 the lone "foreigner" was Berry, a Stoke stalwart in his final season at the club.But while Berry may have been born near Rostrup, in Germany, he was a Welshman whose career began at Wolves before joining Stoke in 1982.Points on the map2009-10: Dean Whitehead is Tony Pulis' big summer signing, an Englishman born in

BBC Sport explains the key points of the new system:- Clubs register a squad of up to 25 players, which must include at least eight 'home-grown' players, at the end of each transfer window.- Home-grown players do not have to be English; home-grown players are defined as those who "irrespective of nationality or age, have been affiliated to the FA or Welsh FA for a period of three seasons or 36 months prior to 21st birthday"- Clubs can supplement squad with unlimited number of players under the age of 21.- Changes can be made only during transfer windows, although in exceptional circumstances (eg goalkeeping injury crisis) moves could be allowed.- Players loaned to Football League clubs cannot be replaced, but can regain their spot on return to parent club.- Rules apply only to Premier League matches, not European, FA Cup or League Cup action.- First deadline is 1700 BST on 1 September (24 hours after end of August transfer window).Forty factors fuelling football inflation1 The First Division play-off game is "probably" the richest club game in the world, worth around �34m to the winners, including parachute payments if the club goes straight back down.2 In 2001-02, 32 clubs reported operating profits - 15 from the Premiership, 17 from the Football League.3 The Uefa Champions League is, in effect, the sixth major European League and is worth in the region of �25m to the clubs who reach the semi-finals or final.4 Teams finishing in the top three of the Premiership and taking part in the Champions League stand to make between �44m to �55m from TV, prize money, gate receipts and other commercial spin-offs.5 Clubs qualifying for the Uefa Cup after finishing fourth or fifth in the Premiership stand to make around �24m.6 Premiership clubs who do not compete in Europe and finish outside the top six receive an average of �14m from the BSkyB/ITV broadcasting deal.7 Over the 10 years of the Premiership, Manchester United registered the highest cumulative profits at �229m, with Tottenham Hotspur in second place with �74m.8 Premiership clubs have spent around �1bn on stadium redevelopment since the league formed in 1991-92.9 League match attendances in all four divisions approached 27.8m, the highest for 30 years.10 FA Cup attendances in 2001-02 were up by 8.5 % and Football League Cup gates increased by 12.2%.11 The Premiership is the strongest league in revenue terms. England's total income rose 21% to reach �1.748bn (�1.2bn) and the Premiership receives more revenue than France and Germany put together.12 Clubs in the Premiership reported operating profits of �84m, the highest since 1997-98, with 83% of clubs reporting an operating profit.13 The five Premiership clubs with the biggest pre-tax losses were Fulham (�40m), Leeds United (�34m), Arsenal (�22m), Chelsea (�17m) and Middlesbrough (�16m).14 In 2001-02, Manchester United reported the highest operating profit at �34m, followed by Newcastle United at �15m.15 Promotion from the First Division to the Premiership at the end of the 2001-02 season was worth around �16m in extra income for the successful clubs.16 The average income for a Premiership club was �56.6m. However only seven of the 20 clubs achieved this figure - Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Newcastle United, Chelsea, Leeds United and Arsenal.17 These seven clubs apart, the average income for the rest of the Premiership dropped to �37m, indicating that a "league within a league" has been formed.18 The average Premiership club has an income four times greater than its First Division counterpart, which earns around �12.4m. This is likely to increase to six times greater over the next few years.19 The average income for a Second Division club was �4.3m, and �2.7m for a Third Division club.20 The cost of relegation from the Premiership to the First Division is around �12m in reduced income.21 League position and wage bills are closely related. The top five payers in the Premiership also finished in the top five.22 Average wages for players have increased 700% during the Premiership's existence.23 In 1992-93 the average wage for a Premiership player was �75,000 per year. In 2001-02 the average wage for a Premiership player was �600,000.24 In 1992-93 the average wage for a First Division player was �50,000 while in 2001-02 it was �200,000. Over the same period, the Second Division average wage went from �20,000 to �70,000 and the Division Three average wage increased from �15,000 in 1992-93 to �42,000 in 2001-02.25 The biggest spenders in the transfer market over the past six season have been Manchester United, followed by Leeds United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur.26 South-west London saw the greatest activity in the transfer market in the 2001-02 season with Fulham and their neighbours Chelsea spending a total of �59m between them.27 Spending between Premiership clubs on transfers stood at �93.5m in 2002-03 with an average of �3.2m per transfer.28 The amount of money filtering down from the Premiership to the Football League via transfers was only �18m.29 Large amounts of cash continue to leave the English game with clubs buying players from abroad. A net outflow of �190m was recorded, consisting of �159m from the Premiership and �31m from the Football League.30 The average crowd capacity at a Premiership club's stadium is 37,000.31 The average price of a ticket for a Premiership game is �25.32 Football League attendances in 2001-02 stood at 14.7m, up 8.5% on the previous season.33 The average Premiership attendance was 34,324. Total Premiership match attendances broke through the 13m barrier in 2001-02.34 Average First Division attendance was 15,000 in 2001-02 and the Second Division average was 7,200. The Third Division average attendance was 4,345.35 Manchester United topped the table of most valuable players on their books, recording their players worth at �82.2m in 2001-02. They were followed by Leeds United, who had player assests valued at �66.5m. Homegrown players do not feature on clubs' balance sheets.36 In total, the 92 clubs in the Premiership and Football League recorded a pre-tax loss of �204m.37 The Premiership is the best attended top division in European football. Its average crowd is 11% above its nearest rival, the German Bundesliga.38 Income from merchandising represents 27% of total commerical income for Premiership clubs. Broadcasting revenue has become the largest single source of income for Premiership clubs, overtaking matchday income.39 The average Premiership club earns �50m more revenue than the average First Division club - more than �1bn in total difference between the two divisions.40 The average Premiership club pays �35.3m in wages, up from �28.1m in 2000-01.Premier League falls behind German Bundesliga as Europe most profitable football leagueGermany's Bundesliga has overtaken the Barclays Premier League as Europe�s most profitable football division.The Premier League�s operating profits fell by 57 percent to �79m in 2008-09 - the lowest levels since 1999-2000.It is only the second time since the Premier League began in 1992-93 that it has not been Europe�s most profitable league.The Bundesliga recorded a �146m profit as revenue increased by �116m and wages went up by just �68m, according to Deloitte�s Annual Review of Football Finance.The German first division also recorded the highest attendances in Europe for the seventh successive season � attracting 8,000 more people per game than the Premier League.The Premier League remains by far the biggest division in terms of generating revenue, which actually increased by �49m, but this was swallowed up by a �132m increase in wages.English top flight clubs spent in excess of �1.32billion on employee salaries � more than Italy�s Serie A (�0.93bn), Spain�s La Liga (�800m), the Bundesliga (�684m) and France�s Lique 1 (�615m).The average Premier League footballer earned an estimated �21,600 a week or �1.1m a year in 2008-09 as top flight clubs each spent an average of �41m on player wages.At a loss: Premier League chief executive Richard ScudamoreTo compare, the average player in the Championship earned around a quarter of this: �275,000 a year or �5,300 a week.Only Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and the three clubs promoted at the start of the 2008-09 season � West Bromwich Albion, Stoke City and Hull City, who all had much lower wage bills � made a profit. The other 14 Premier League clubs recorded combined losses of �117m.Deloitte suggest clubs spend around 55 percent of their revenue on wages to achieve �effective cost management� but, on average, Premier League sides spent 67 percent.This was a record high and an increase of five percent from the previous year, although it is still lower than Serie A (73 percent) and Lique 1 (69 percent).Yet only Arsenal (46 percent) and Manchester United (44 percent) managed to meet Deloitte�s recommendations in 2008-09, with nine clubs spending more than 70 percent of their revenue on wages � a ratio regarded as a �warning level�.It will come as no surprise that Portsmouth, who finished 14th in 2008-09 but were forced into administration and relegated last season, were the only Premier League side to spend more in wages than they made in revenue. The club� s wage bill accounted for 109 percent of their revenue.But the warning signs were there the season before, in which Harry Redknapp�s Portsmouth won the FA Cup, as the club spent 76 percent of revenue on wages.Dan Jones, a partner in Deloitte�s Sport Business Group, said: �In 1995 we commented that �we believe controlling the wage bill is, long term, football�s biggest challenge� and this year�s figures illustrate the extent to which that challenge is becoming a real threat.�Break even: Champions Chelsea could miss out on European football if they do not comply with new UEFA rules in two years timeBreak even: Champions Chelsea could miss out on European football if they do not comply with new UEFA rules in two years timeUnder UEFA�s new financial fair play rules, clubs will be expected to break even over a rolling three-year period if they want to play in the Champions League or Europa League.But the growth in wages is difficult to slow down because players have signed three- or four-year contracts. The Deloitte report suggests that performance-related pay could be the way to address the problem.�Clubs should learn valuable lessons from the best of the corporate world,� it says, �where basic pay is set at affordable levels, with bonuses built into contracts only if performance (and profit) allows it.�Wages should be structured so they flex automatically for meaningful success, not just appearances, rather than trigger a financial crisis.�Chelsea complete Shevchenko dealChelsea have completed the signing of striker Andriy Shevchenko from AC Milan for a fee of about �30m.The 29-year-old signed a four-year contract on Wednesday after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical."I am here for the challenge and the excitement of the Premier League," said the Ukraine captain.The exact fee has not been disclosed, but it is believed it beats the �30m Manchester United gave Leeds in 2002 for England defender Rio Ferdinand.It is certainly a club record fee for Chelsea, eclipsing the �24.5m they paid for Lyon's Michael Essien in 2005.For him to leave Milan for Chelsea is a big statement about where Chelsea isChelsea boss Jose MourinhoShevchenko, former European Footballer of the Year, added: "I am going from one big club to another and joining a team of champions."There is a right moment to join a football club and I think I have arrived here at the perfect time."The Champions League has to be a realistic target for next season but it is not just about the Champions League. Chelsea is going for their third Premiership as well and I like the club's mentality of wanting to win every game they play."I have followed Mr (Jose) Mourinho's career carefully for the last few years and have been hugely impressed with the way he manages."He puts team ethic before individual expression which is the way I believe great teams are created."Had money been my motivation for coming, I would probably have stayed in Milan."I am pleased that Chelsea managed to conclude everything before the World Cup - I can go to Germany with a clear mind and proud to be a Chelsea player."Chelsea manager Mourinho said: "Today is a day when the dream became reality. Andriy has always been my first choice for Chelsea since I arrived."Before it was not possible, now it is for real. He has great qualities, ambition, discipline, tactical awareness and of course he is a great goalscorer."I did not need to meet with him to convince him about Chelsea, in the same way we did not need to talk a lot about why I wanted him. Everybody knows him as a player, tactically he can play in the Chelsea system no doubt."Milan is a big club, a great club, but for him to leave Milan for Chelsea is a big statement about where Chelsea is."He is a champion and he is joining a team of champions. I have already spoken to some of our players and they are looking forward to playing with him. Great players want to play with other great players."Chief Executive Peter Kenyon added: "The deal is a new club transfer record and is a straight cash deal. We are delighted to have signed one of Europe's greatest goalscorers."The news that Shevchenko had finalised his switch was first broken by AC Milan's website, which said in a statement: "AC Milan communicates it has ceded definitely the sporting rights of Andriy Shevchenko to Chelsea."The club swiftly released another statement saying: "Milan thank Shevchenko, an extraordinary man and striker, for the great amount of excitement he provided in the seven seasons in which he wore the red and black shirt."His 173 goals, making him the second top scorer in the club's history, have contributed in a vital manner to the winning of an Italian league title, an Italian Cup, Super Cup, a Champions League and a European Supercup."Shevchenko, born in Dvirkivshchyna, Ukraine, on 29 September 1976, began his career with Dynamo Kiev, making his debut as a teenager in 1994.In 1997-98, when already a Ukraine international, he sprung to the attention of the European game when he scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 win over Barcelona at the Nou Camp.In 1999 he joined AC Milan and was an instant success - going on to win the European Footballer of the Year prize in 2004.He has also led his country to their first World Cup finals.Shevchenko becomes Chelsea's third signing of the summer after midfielder Michael Ballack from Bayern Munich and Feyenoord striker Salomon Kalou.Mourinho is also reported to be interested in signing Real Madrid and Brazil defender Roberto Carlos and goalkeeper Hilario from Portuguese club Nacional de Madeira.Man City beat Chelsea to RobinhoManchester City have beaten Chelsea to the signing of Brazilian forward Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of about �32.5m.Chelsea had been chasing the 24-year-old but City have captured him on a four-year deal with a late bid."I am absolutely delighted to get the opportunity to work with such an incredible talent like Robinho," City boss Mark Hughes told the club website."This is a real statement of intent as to the ambitions of this club."After missing out on Robinho, Chelsea issued a statement saying they were unable to agree a deal with Real as they were not prepared to pay the Spanish club's asking price.City made the audacious attempt to sign Robinho on transfer deadline day after earlier agreeing to a takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group.Hughes added: "I have said that in order to compete with the best teams in the Premier League we have to be in the market for players of this calibre, and Robinho is undoubtedly one of the best players in the world."I am really looking forward to introducing him to the rest of the squad, and to the City fans at the earliest opportunity."Real Madid president Ramon Calderon said Robinho, who called a news conference on Sunday stating again his desire to leave the Bernabeu club, had broken down in tears as he pleaded for a move.Robinho appears to have been unhappy with Real and their willingness to sell him to fund a failed move to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United."We have sold Robinho for reasons of a human nature and for sporting reasons," Calderon told Spanish television station Veo."The fact that he has accepted an offer from Manchester City says that he is not going for sporting reasons."It's an important sum of money. It's not the objective of Real Madrid to sell players, neither do we need the money, but for reasons of human and sporting nature, it has been decided this is for the best."It's a decision agreed by all the coaching staff, who understand it is best for the player and for the club."(Coach Bernd) Schuster thought until yesterday that he could recover the player, but that has not been the case."Every time I have spoken with him he was very sad, crying and asking to leave Spain. Real Madrid are more important than any one player."He's a great kid, but badly advised."Chelsea had been favourites to sign Robinho but Real apparently refused to sanction a switch for him to join them as they were upset at the Stamford Bridge club's conduct in the matter.Robinho could now make his debut for City in their next league game, which is ironically against Chelsea on 13 September.He joins up with fellow Brazilian Jo at City after he moved to the club from CSKA Moscow.Robinho is a regular in the Brazil side and helped Santos win their first league title as an 18-year-old in 2002.He drew comparisons with Brazilian legend Pele and joined Real from Santos in August 2005 after pressing for a move.Robinho struggled in his first season but won the Spanish title under coach Fabio Capello in 2007.A player with pace and trickery, he came into his own last season when he scored 11 goals in 32 outings to help Real to a second successive La Liga crown.He was also top scorer with six goals when Brazil won the 2007 Copa America.Liverpool sign Andy Carroll from NewcastleLiverpool have signed striker Andy Carroll from Newcastle for a club record fee of about �35m."Andy Carroll has completed his move from Newcastle to Liverpool and has signed a five-and-a-half-year-deal," read a Liverpool statement.The 22-year-old will wear the number nine shirt vacated by Fernando Torres, who has sealed his move to Chelsea.Carroll has scored 11 goals in 19 league games this season and made his full England debut in November.Newcastle confirmed that Carroll's transfer request was "reluctantly accepted" on Monday afternoon, and his move was finalised shortly before the transfer deadline (2300 GMT).Liverpool have also signed Ajax striker Luis Suarez for a �22.7m fee, but recouped about �50m of their transfer-day spending by selling Fernando Torres to Chelsea.Academy graduate Carroll played a key role in the Magpies' promotion from the Championship last season and had continued to shine since being handed the club's number nine shirt during the summer.Newcastle boss Alan Pardew had repeatedly stated that the player was not for sale but the club's owner Mike Ashley and managing director Derek Llambias have tried to bring a financial realism to the club during their time at the helm.Former Magpies and England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Radio 5 live fans would be "angry and disappointed" that Carroll was sold, but the huge transfer fee would have been difficult to turn down."I'm staggered just like the rest of Newcastle fans," said Shearer."It's an incredible amount of money, you have to say that, for a guy who's scored - what is it? - 14 goals and had half a season in the Premier League, albeit having done very well and the potential is there."He's a very young guy, he's been in trouble once or twice before and that would be the major concern.""It's all right selling your best player, but not getting anyone in to replace him is staggering."People are saying that Liverpool have sold Torres, but they have got two guys in [Luis Suarez and Carroll] for over �50m to replace him. I just hope Newcastle invest some of the �35m in new players at the end of the season."He is a huge loss, he has carried Newcastle at times this season. There are not many players like him."Carroll was reported in Tuesday's Daily Star to have sent texts to Steve Wraith, editor of the Toon Talk fanzine, claiming he felt he had being forced out of the club.And Shearer added: "I wouldn't be surprised if he did not want to leave. I know he handed in a transfer request late in the day but I am not sure he wanted to leave."Carroll is currently out of action with a torn thigh muscle which has kept him sidelined for the last five games and which prompted his visit to a specialist in Sweden on Friday.Liverpool also signed Coventry City's England Under-17 midfielder Conor Thomas.The 17 year-old joins on loan for the rest of the season with a view to a permanent move.Blues wrap up Torres dealChelsea have completed their transfer deadline day swoop for Fernando Torres from Liverpool.Chelsea have completed their transfer deadline-day swoop for Fernando Torres from Liverpool on a five-and-a-half-year contract.The deal went right down to the wire ahead of the transfer window closing, with Torres only travelling down to London late on Monday evening to undergo a last-minute medical.But the Blues managed to push through the late deal before the window slammed shut, with the Spaniard penning a contract thought to be worth around �50million - a British transfer record.Premier League champions Chelsea first made a move for the Spaniard on Thursday with an unsuccessful �35m offer for his services.And Carlo Ancelotti's side persisted in their chase for the striker, despite the Reds insisting he was not on the market.Liverpool changed their stance over 26-year-old Torres after moving for Newcastle striking ace Andy Carroll and Ajax star Luis Suarez in two last-minute swoops of their own on Monday.SwoopA statement on Torres' official website said: "Spain international Fernando Torres will defend the Blue shirt of Chelsea after joining the London club on the January transfer deadline."The striker has signed for the reigning Premier League and FA Cup champions for five and a half seasons."After Liverpool and Chelsea had reached an agreement, the player travelled down to London where he successfully passed his medical before agreeing personal terms."Fernando Torres then put pen to paper on a deal that will see the forward remain at Chelsea until June 2016."Torres says he is delighted to complete the move to Stamford Bridge."I am very happy with my transfer to Chelsea and I am looking forward very much to helping my new team-mates this season and for many years to come," he said."Having played against Chelsea many times since coming to England, and in some very big games I will never forget, I know there are many great players here and I will work hard to win a place in the team."I hope I can score some important goals for the supporters to enjoy this season."SignificantChelsea chairman Bruce Buck added: "This is a very significant day for Chelsea, capturing one of the best players in the world with his peak years ahead of him."We have long admired the talents of a player who is a proven goalscorer in English football and Fernando's arrival is a sign of our continuing high ambitious. I hope every Chelsea fan is as excited as I am with this news."Torres established himself as a key player at Anfield during his time on Merseyside, but has struggled to find his top form this season.The Spaniard, who spent almost four years at Liverpool after arriving from Atletico Madrid in 2007, could take on his former club as early as this weekend when the Reds travel to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League.Football / The Premier Kick-Off: Ferguson's false startDAVE BASSETT'S stunt of staging a Christmas party last week may have tricked slow-starting Sheffield United into their New Year form. If it seemed rather early to be posing as Santa Claus, Alex Ferguson proved there is no sanity clause by talking afterwards as if it were last Easter and the fates were again mocking Manchester United.At Bramall Lane in April, a Leeds victory sealed by a bizarre own goal from Sheffield's captain, Brian Gayle, crushed Ferguson's title hopes. Now, standing where Howard Wilkinson had diplomatically insisted it was far from over, the Manchester manager's frustration was directed at the referee, Brian Hill.Livid at losing to a penalty after being refused an indisputable one when Ryan Giggs fell under Simon Tracey's lunge, Ferguson claimed Old Trafford would have 'protested vigorously' had they known beforehand who was officiating.Hostility to Hill - 'We don't want this man' - dates back to 1988-89 when Ferguson alleged that the Kettering official 'denied us three penalties' in a League Cup defeat at Wimbledon. There was also an FA Cup loss to Nottingham Forest, when Hill refused a goal after a Brian McClair shot apparently crossed the line.After that, Ferguson revealed, his club asked for Hill to be kept away from their fixtures. He inferred that the Football League had complied, though Hill took United's game at Tottenham a year later. Told of the remarks, Hill said: 'I'm totally amazed - I get on fine with their players.'The episode raises some interesting questions. Was it coincidence which kept Hill and United apart so long, and if not, did Ferguson dictate who should handle their matches? Was he suggesting that Hill is biased against his team? And did the country's richest and most powerful club, who incidentally could not raise a substitute goalkeeper, really not know who the referee was? Ferguson's outburst may have implications, with the FA confirming yesterday that it will examine his comments with a view to possible disciplinary action.The controversy detracted from a hard-earned home win and the historic first Premier League goal, headed by Brian Deane under the scrutiny of the England manager, Graham Taylor. The Tracey- Giggs incident, 14 minutes later, assumed greater significance when Gary Pallister toppled Alan Cork and Deane converted Sheffield's first spot-kick in 18 months.In a twist on the new back-pass rule, the opening goal had its origins in a Tracey clearance under pressure. The second followed a pass by John Gannon, the most accomplished midfielder on view, when he might previously have turned the ball back. Mark Hughes's reply, after Peter Schmeichel's up-and-under, was sardonically described by Bassett as 'a Sheffield United goal'.That, plus the late appearance of the former Cambridge target man, Dion Dublin, does not mean Manchester now espouse the long-ball game. Even without Bryan Robson, Neil Webb and Paul Ince, who is likely to miss Wednesday's visit of Everton with a rib injury, they looked more fluid. Boxing Day - the real one, not Bassett's version - might be a better time to assess their prospects.Goals: Deane (5) 1-0; Deane pen (50) 2-0; Hughes (61) 2-1.Sheffield United: Tracey; Gage, Barnes, Gannon (Hartfield, 86), Beesley, McLeary, Bradshaw, Lake, Cork, Deane, Hodges (Bryson, 68).

I don't believe it for one minute.606: DEBATEIt's about time a manager came in and spoke the truth! Every word he said was true!50 years with nothing"Why is it the most watched? The numbers tell you it is the most exciting league in the world."Keegan said after Sunday's game: "This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world."But Scudamore thinks that the 2007/08 season has been far from boring."It is Kevin, we know Kevin and we love him, he is fantastic," said Scudamore."His great quality is that he wears his heart on his sleeve and that is his great strength and that is why we love him."But I think he's just gone through the heat of battle, he's just competed very, very well for 60 minutes, he thought he had a chance of winning the game and all of sudden they've lost 2-0 and then a microphone goes under his nose and he says that."I don't think it is necessarily boring but it is a challenge for him to get Newcastle from where they are now into the top four and I don't necessarily think that is boring and is one he will attack with vigour and passion."Scudamore also defended the theory that the title race is too predictable and that the Premier League was just about the top four.He said: "There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.It is also for the good of English football that we now have teams dominating in EuropeRichard Scudamore"In simple terms two of the three promoted clubs normally stay up so it is not necessarily the case that the promoted teams go down."You just have to look at statistics which say that while it is hard to get in the Premier League and stay in the Premier League that does not necessarily make it boring."Alex McLeish says Aston Villa struggle to compete with top clubsAston Villa manager Alex McLeish admits the club and the majority of the Premier League cannot compete with the growing new breed of "super clubs".Villa have sold Ashley Young, Stewart Downing, Gareth Barry, James Milner and Gary Cahill, who all appeared for England against Wales  in midweek.McLeish says he has tried to balance the books at the club since leaving Birmingham to take over in June.He said: "We can't compete with the super clubs."The Scot added: "They are on a different planet. There are a bunch of clubs that are very difficult for everyone else to compete with in the long run, no doubt about it."McLeish, whose side visit Everton on Saturday, added: "Everybody in football, no matter who it is, has their price. But, in one-off games, there is always a possibility with the great competitiveness of the Premier League that you will get results."Time and time again we've said we are looking to get our finances on an even keel."But the former Rangers manager is also content with his squad after acquiring Alan Hutton and Jermaine Jenas  from Tottenham before the transfer window closed.He said: "We lost Luke Young  and Jean Makoun  , so it was two chunks of experience out of the squad that I felt was important to replace."Have I got enough now? I've never got enough. There is no doubt we are trying to keep things on an even keel while maintaining our competitive position. I think the two players we have brought in are two good acquisitions."Striker Darren Bent is on course to return for action with Villa this weekend after missing England's Euro 2012 qualifiers  against Bulgaria and Wales with a groin problem.Fifa wants 18-team Premier LeagueFifa is heading for a showdown with the Premier League over its 20-club size.On Thursday Fifa's Congress endorsed a proposal for Europe's top leagues to be reduced to a maximum of 18 clubs by the start of the 2007-08 season.Fifa president Sepp Blatter said: "We've been given the power to work on it. We'll do it. It'll give four more days to the international calendar."But Premier League spokesman Dan Johnson ruled out a reduction: "There's no appetite for this kind of change."Johnson added: "The only people who are going to tell us how to run the Premier League are the league's 20 member clubs' chairmen."They are the only ones who can change the composition of the league and they are just not going to go for this - no way."Fifa's decision could also hit the Spanish, Italian, and French leagues.Premier League v England time-lineMay 1992: The Premier League is established as a limited company three months after top-flight clubs resign from the football league. First Premier League season begins in AugustJune 1992: A 2-1 defeat to Sweden in Stockholm means England fail to advance past the group stages of Euro'92, just two years after they reached the semi-finals of the World Cup in ItalyNovember 1993: England fail to qualify for USA 1994, the first time they have missed out on qualification for an international tournament since Euro'84February 1996: England sink to their lowest-ever Fifa ranking of 26thApril 1999: Dave Richards is appointed chairman of the Premier LeagueNovember 1999: Richard Scudamore is appointed chief executive of the Premier LeagueDecember 1999: Chelsea become the first time in English football to field a starting XI containing no English playersJanuary 2001: Sven-Goran Eriksson becomes the first oversees manager of the national sideMay 2006: Scudamore secures a �2.5bn global TV deal for the Premier League.

Each individual televised match will now cost the broadcasters �6.6m, up from �4.7m under the previous deal.BSkyB, which has built its business over 20 years on the back of live top flight football, retained most of the rights, securing 116 matches per season from 2013-14 in exchange for �2.3bn over three years.But BT sprung a huge surprise by winning the rights to 38 games, including almost half the "first pick" games on offer, in exchange for �738m over three years. Richard Scudamore, Premier League chief executive, said BT's securing 18 of the 38 coveted "first pick" matches would be a "game changer". "[BT chief executive] Ian Livingstone and his colleagues have hugely ambitious plans. They have not invested in all this fibre [optic cable] for nothing, they want to establish a direct relationship with consumers," he said.BT � the latest challenger to Sky after Setanta and ESPN � is expected to launch a new sports channel, available on a variety of platforms. But BT will use the rights to push its high speed broadband service. Its matches will be shown at Saturday lunchtime and on midweek evenings.Against a grim economic backdrop elsewhere, Scudamore admitted he was "surprised" by the huge hike in income, which he said would allow clubs to continue to compete with their European rivals.The huge increase in income is good news for club owners, players, their agents and luxury car dealerships and, on the evidence of previous deals, is likely to lead to another sharp rise in transfer fees. But despite the unprecedented riches that have flowed into the coffers of top flight clubs during the Premier League era, clubs made losses of �361m last year despite record income of �2.3bn.Scudamore pleaded with clubs not to simply use the new deal to rack up losses and fuel wage inflation. While he said he wanted clubs to still invest in the best talent, he also made a plea to invest in infrastructure and youth development."We are entering a new era with financial fair play [the new Europe-wide regulations of club spending], I'm hoping it will get invested in things other than playing talent. It should also be able to achieve sustainability," he said.The effect on fans is more uncertain. BT and Sky may have to charge more to cover their huge investment. When asked whether clubs would use the windfall to subsidise ticket prices, Scudamore would say only that it "gives them more choices".Tony Ball, the former BSkyB chief executive who helped fuel the company's growth in the mid-1990s, is a non-executive director on the BT board and is likely to have advised it on its bidding strategy. ESPN, the US giant that entered the market when Setanta went bust trying to compete with Sky, has now been frozen out.Scudamore said the deal would give more certainty to his member clubs. "It allows people to plan and gives us a degree of financial security. I don't underestimate that. The idea you can plan with some certainty your revenues for next four years is a big thing."He said that he hoped that clubs would use the windfall to plan prudently for the future and reduce their losses, reducing their reliance on benefactors. But history would suggest the majority will flow directly into the pockets of players."Priority number one is retain and attract top talent but there ought to be a way of doing that while achieving sustainability. Some of it ought to be used to reduce losses."He added that the windfall would help clubs comply with new European regulations forcing them to break even.The first TV deal of the Premier League era was worth �304m over five years. Under the new deal, clubs will be guaranteed �3bn from live rights, plus �180m from the BBC for Match of the Day.Once internet rights and overseas sales, which brought in �1.4bn under the current deals, are taken into account, the total is likely to easily top �5bn over three years.Scudamore refused to elaborate on other bidders but ESPN, the US sports giant that entered the market when Setanta went bust, and al-Jazeera are among those believed to have ratcheted up the price for Sky and BT.Scudamore said the breakneck climax to the season, with the league title and relegation issues going to the wire, had helped fuel the appetite for the Premier League "product"."I've been five times round this block and each time people say the bubble has burst. As long as we invest in the top talent, as long as we invest in compelling competitive football, as long as we have teams in the bottom three beating teams in the top three, we have a compellingly competitive competition."Top Soccer Leagues Get 25% Rise in TV Rights Sales, Report SaysNov. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Growth in television rights deals in Germany and England lifted broadcast revenues of Europe�s top five soccer leagues 25 percent to a combined 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) a season, according to a report.TV Sports Markets, an information provider for broadcasters and sports organizations, said in its Football Media Money League report that the latest cycle of rights sales through 2016 in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain added 1 billion euros a season to the previous three-year period.�League football remains the most sought-after media content in the world and all the indications are that broadcaster appetite for the sport at elite level shows no sign of diminishing,� Frank Dunne, Editor of TV Sports Markets, said in an e-mailed statement.Demand for soccer broadcasting was underlined two days ago when BT Group Plc said it�s paying about 900 million pounds ($1.44 billion) for exclusive three-year U.K. live rights for the Champions League and Europa League from 2015-18. The deal is worth worth more than double the current arrangement with British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc and ITV Plc, the British Broadcasting Corp said. Sky said BT�s bid was �far in excess� of its own valuation.England�s Premier League generates 2.2 billion euros a year in domestic and international television rights sales, more than double the 975 million euros earned by second-ranked Italy�s Serie A, according to the TV Sports Markets report.Bundesliga RightsWhile the German Bundesliga�s rights sales of 541 million euros per season is the lowest of the five leagues, the 54 percent rise in its domestic contract is bettered only by the Premier League�s 63 percent jump. England�s elite competition is in the first season of a three-year agreement with BSkyB and BT Group worth 3.02 billion pounds. The Bundesliga�s TV income will grow to 674 million euros per season from 2015, the report said.�The domestic rights in German football have historically been low because of the lack of competition in the German pay-TV market,� Dunne said. �Only in the most recent deal, when Deutsche Telekom looked like being a genuine rival, was Sky Deutschland forced to up its price.�Spain�s Primera Division ranked third, generating 70 million euros more than the 710 million euros made by France�s Ligue 1. The Spanish league is the only one of the five competitions which doesn�t sell its rights collectively.Real, BarcaAs a result Real Madrid and Barcelona, its two biggest teams, secure more money from television rights than rivals in other countries. Real earned a combined 178.4 million euros, about 3 million euros more than Barca, from the sale of TV rights to league, domestic cup and European Champions League matches, according to the report.�The two Spanish clubs have benefited in recent years from strong performances in the Champions League,� said Dunne. �But their real advantage over clubs in the rest of Europe is down to the system of individual selling of media rights by La Liga clubs, which guarantees them the lion�s share of the earnings from their domestic broadcast deals.�The arrangement also gives them an advantage when it comes to new regulations introduced by European soccer body UEFA that seek to stop clubs from spending beyond their means. According to accountant Deloitte LLP, the Spanish duo rank first and second in total soccer income, with nine-time European champion Real leading with 512.6 million euros during the 2011-12 season.Turnover Equals Talent�Financial fair play is predicated on the fact the teams with highest turnover will be able to spend the most on labor,� Sean Hamil, director of the University of London�s Birkbeck Sport Business Centre, said in a telephone interview. �If you�re one of the most-popular clubs and you�re able to sell your own broadcasting rights you�ll have higher turnover.�Collective selling still has its benefits, according to Hamil, as seen in the success of the Premier League, where champion Manchester United got 20 million pounds more than the 40 million pounds paid to last-place Queens Park Rangers. More equitable distribution means that �one club can beat another on any given day,� Hamil said. Barca and Real�s TV income accounts for about half of the Primera Division�s total.Access to the Champions League helped Italy�s Juventus and AC Milan, with 154 million euros and 124 million euros respectively, secure the third and fourth highest TV incomes for individual clubs, according to the Football Media Money League report. The teams benefited from a performance-based pay structure and a share of the TV rights payments made by broadcasters in the clubs� home markets.Manchester United has the most TV income among English clubs, getting 108 million euros last season, the report said. That�s 1 million euros more than Europa League holders Chelsea received.TOP 10 SOCCER TEAMS BY TV INCOME, SEASON 2012-13================================================CLUB                     SALES(EU MILLIONS)1.

Manchester City       989. Bayern Munich         9210. Paris Saint-Germain   89Liverpool get in Champions LeagueLiverpool have been given the chance to defend their Champions League crown after Uefa handed them a place in the first qualifying round for next season.The Reds beat AC Milan in last season's final but, because they finished out of the Premiership's top four, were not guaranteed entry in 2005-2006.Uefa's executive committee changed its rules on Friday to allow Liverpool in."We wish to express our thanks to those who supported us and campaigned," said chief executive Rick Parry.The key points:Liverpool get the smallest share of England's television money if they reach the group stages.But any other English teams involved - from Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton - will still get less money than they would have done were Liverpool not involved.Liverpool get no "country protection" preventing them meeting other English clubs. But they are seeded. This means they could face Everton in the third qualifying round, but not Manchester United, and could be in a group with Chelsea, but not Arsenal.In future, the title holders will be entered automatically.Rafael Benitez's men will now face a first qualifying round first leg on 12 or 13 July and a second leg on 19 or 20 July.That means they will now probably have to cancel scheduled friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Cologne.And if successful in the first qualifying round, they will probably also have to cancel a pre-season tour of Japan, where they are due to play Shimizu S-Pulse and Kashima Antlers.Uefa chief executive Lars-Christer Olsson told BBC Radio Five Live the decision by the 14-man executive committee was unanimous."Unanimous means that everybody is supporting it. By definition, that is also the case here."There were no discussions actually on where they should enter the competition because everybody was of the opinion they should be given the opportunity but they have to start from the beginning."They could not be allowed to get into the 32 for example."But while there is joy for Liverpool, there has been disappointment for Manchester City.Man City blow despite Reds U-turnThe Uefa Cup spot which Liverpool had earned for finishing fifth in the Premiership will not transfer to another English club so City, who would have been next in line, will not be in Europe.And it is likely that Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton will be unhappy at potentially sharing the television money with one other club.Uefa spokesman William Gaillard admitted splitting the pot five ways rather than four will be "a burden on the other English-based clubs".If Manchester United or Everton fail to reach the group stage but Liverpool do the pot could go back to being split four ways - but anyone involved from England will still get less because of the Reds.If four English clubs reach the group stages, Chelsea will get 40%, Arsenal 30% and two out of Manchester United, Liverpool and Everton will get 15% each.If all five get through Uefa will think again.But while the others will feel hard done by, even Liverpool have suffered in comparison with other Champions League winners.Normally the title holders get 30% of the money for their country if they are not also the domestic champions.Meanwhile Uefa insists the saga which has dogged it since Liverpool finished fifth domestically and then won the Champions League will never be repeated."The Uefa executive committee decided to amend the regulations for the future editions of the Champions League, so that the holders will have the right to defend their title and therefore qualify automatically," said a statement on the organisation's website.The new system is in marked contrast to 2000, when Real Madrid won the Champions League but finished outside of Spain's qualification positions.On that occasion fourth-placed Real Zaragoza were relegated to the Uefa Cup.Reacting to the news, Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann told BBC Radio Five Live: "It's tremendous news, great for the club."We've still got two or three weeks to prepare, which should be enough to get in physical shape to cope with the pre-season schedule."And Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick added: "We thank the Uefa executive committee and especially its president Lennart Johansson for listening to the strength of the argument for Liverpool's entry."We always said that this was an exceptional situation which required an exceptional solution. For the very first time, one country has five teams in the Champions League and we have to be delighted at that."We believed there were very strong sporting reasons for Liverpool to defend their title, not least after that fantastic final in Istanbul. That view has prevailed, and rightly so."Sports minister Richard Caborn added: "I'm delighted that Uefa have decided to allow Liverpool to defend their trophy."This is a triumph for common sense and the spirit of sport. I look forward to the start of the new season and the British clubs making a powerful impact again."But some Liverpool supporters are unhappy with the decision.Les Lawson, spokesman for the Liverpool International Supporters' Club, said: "Uefa has been caught with egg on their faces over this because the FA put the first four in the Premiership into next season's tournament."It means Uefa has had to sort it out and they have done the minimum possible. They have treated their own champions with contempt."It is a disgrace. Liverpool are the top team in Europe because they are the holders and have beaten Europe's best. They are being treated like TNS or other very small clubs."To be told they have to start in the first qualifier is wrong and a real kick in the teeth."And Alan Kennedy, who scored the winning goal for the Reds in the 1981 final against Real Madrid, added: "Coming in at the early stages disregards where Liverpool finished in the Champions League."They won it, so they should be entitled to be in at the third qualifying round."Barclays nets Premier League dealBarclays has renewed its sponsorship deal with the FA Premier League in a contract worth �65.8m.The new deal will take the bank's sponsorship of the Premiership up to 2010, in a three-year extension to Barclays' current contract.The league, formed in 1992, has had a sponsor since 1993, with Barclays backing it since 2004.From 2001 until 2004, Barclaycard was the official sponsor and prior to that it was the Carling lager brand.'Fantastic appeal'Barclays president Bob Diamond said the deal fitted the firm's expanding international business."We all know about the fantastic appeal of the Barclays Premiership in the UK but this sponsorship also fits our international presence and aspirations particularly in Asia and continental Europe," he said.The deal will also see the bank sponsor the Premier League's official pre-season tournament, the Premier League Asia Trophy.History and time are key to power of football, says Premier League chiefRichard Scudamore, chief executive of the Barclays Premier League, knows he is in a privileged position. When it comes to selling a British company abroad, he has a head-start on most other businesses. After all, he has no need to explain what he is selling.�I go in and talk about something people recognise,� he says. �I don�t have to tell people who I am or where I am from. It�s a bit like being the Queen or the BBC.�Not many institutions can boast such instant recognition, but the Premier League has that advantage and more. The rights have been sold in 212 territories and there are none left to conquer.�I�ve never had a problem doing business,� Scudamore says. �We can go anywhere, because of who we are.�The Premier League has become a worldwide business, and Scudamore says that it is partly due to a commercial decision, made at the turn of the century, that changed the way broadcasting rights were sold. He was unhappy that they were being sold to just one agency, with the agency taking its cut. Now Scudamore deals with the rights on an individual basis, having what he says is a �direct relationship� with the broadcasters. His three-strong team deals with 80 different broadcasters.Another big change is the influx of foreign players. Back in 1992 there were only 11 non-British or Irish footballers in the Premier League. That has changed significantly.�We had 71 different nationalities playing last season,� says Scudamore, who has been chief executive for nearly 15 years. �That means 71 avid international markets.�The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world (its TV audience is 4.7 billion) and the latest deals made (each is on a three-year cycle; the next starts from the 2013-14 season) will bring in �3 billion in the UK, and up to �2.5 billion internationally.Although football is now a global sport, the Premier League sells itself very much along British lines. �Being British is the essence of what we are,� Scudamore says. �Why would we play that down?�We�ve got two fantastic things in our advantage,� he says. �One is our heritage, culture, history and the authenticity of it all. People crave that authenticity, whether it is a British landmark or a crest on a football shirt that goes back to the 19th century.�However, another British benefit is geographic, rather than historic. �Greenwich Mean Time is very much in our favour,� Scudamore says. �People underestimate the importance of GMT, but when you�re operating a business, it means you sit right in the middle. You can deal with the Far East and California in the same day.�Scudamore accepts that his business is unusual. Not only does it have that instant recognition, but it is also unconnected to product development.�We don�t have to create a new product every time we want to sign a contract,� he says. �Clubs renew players and managers and it feels brand new. What we do is more about product protection � we can concentrate and focus on promotion, selling and marketing.�He and his small team work hard, travelling around the world, but he is convinced that having such a small team is a huge benefit, because �it means people know who to speak to, that we are responsive and consistent in what we do�.When Scudamore talks, it becomes clear that he alsobelieves he uses what some would describe as British values. He emphasises more than once that �courtesy� is vital. �You need to be very clear about what you are selling,� he says, �and that takes time. We sometimes do business with people on our sixth or seventh attempt. We also try to keep relationships going with old licensees. On the last day of the season we e-mailed all of them to say thank you and goodbye to the ones we weren�t going to be working with next year.�The UK is still the Premier League�s largest market, but it seems likely that the value of the overseas broadcasting rights will soon overtake those from the domestic market. The latest agreement, from 2013 to 2016, includes a North American deal that will mean matches shown on NBC and its Spanish language network, Telemundo, will be available to more than 115 million homes. In China, meanwhile, a new six-year contract with Super Sports has all sorts of possibilities, which Scudamore is keen to exploit, especially in a country of 1.3 billion people.Future aims involve �deepening and broadening� relationships with the broadcasters, going beyond the rights and into areas such as programming before and after live matches.However, as the Premier League expands and becomes even more international, Scudamore is emphatic that it needs to retain its British �essence� and remain local.�In a global world, people have access to just about everything. Discerning customers decide what to watch, and we know they like what we are showing more than the rest.�They like the pace of our game and the intensity. And to that, they add the full crowds, the noise and chanting, and the away fans. We need that to continue, for grounds to be full and for all those things to remain. The more global you get, the more local you need to be.�Arsenal bullish over �200m incomeArsenal claim their new position as Britain's richest football club shows they do not need foreign investment.Latest figures reveal the club's turnover has broken the �200m barrier after the move to the Emirates Stadium."These results demonstrate we really don't need any outside investment," managing director Keith Edelman told BBC Radio 5live."We secured all the players we wanted in the summer and manager Arsene Wenger did not spend his budget."The Gunners have been subject to takeover rumours after Alisher Usmanov increased his share in the club to 21% with reports suggesting that he wants to increase his stake to 25%.American billionaire investor Stan Kroenke has a 12% stake and, while he has met with Arsenal, the club have yet to hold talks with Usmanov."I am unsure what he (Usmanov) can do with 25%, and I do not believe he can stop us operating the business on a day-to-day basis," said Edelman."Usmanov has a stake, (Stan) Kroenke has a stake and we get on and run the business every day."It is a distraction for us to keep talking about it, but we are trying to focus on the team getting the job done and we do not think it affects them."He added: "As far as Usmanov is concerned, we have always stated our belief as a responsible corporate body, we meet anybody who requests a meeting, and that is still our policy."Uzbek businessman Usmanov's company, Red and White, is chaired by former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, who claims foreign investment is needed to compete with the likes of Chelsea.But Edelman told the BBC: "We are looking at a position where we don't believe we need additional monies."We had �73.9m cash at the year's end and we are telling people today we've got increased cash balances at this juncture."The move to the new stadium from Highbury means the Premiership leaders are generating more than �3m a game.A statement from the Arsenal Supporters' Trust said the group was delighted with the club's current financial position."These results are a testament to the success of the Emirates project. These results are the fruits of opening the new stadium on time and on budget," the statement read."The club have sown the seeds for a bright new future."The AST studies carefully the different models of how football clubs are run. Arsenal's model, based on sensible borrowing to invest in facilities that generate an increased income stream, is a model we commend."AST reiterates its opposition to any hostile takeover at Arsenal."BBC sports editor Mihir Bose says Arsenal can now argue that this brings them into the big league of European earners, just behind Real Madrid."Manchester United will have to put on another �32m from last year to match the Gunners - Chelsea will have to show an increase of nearly �50m; Liverpool �80m and Tottenham �127m to match Arsenal," stated Bose.He added that Arsenal project that the "Emirates effect will continue to produce vast sums of money for years".And on Dein's ambitions?"One well-placed Emirates source told me: 'David always sees himself as number one. He wants to be chairman. The Arsenal board puts Arsenal first. They see themselves as the custodians of the club. That is the difference'," said Bose.The stake held by Red and White Holdings Limited could see them seek a seat on the Arsenal board - and a return for Dein.But Edelman said: "The board can review anybody being a director at any time, and either accept or decline it."If he had 49.999%, but the board did not think he would add value as a director, it would say no."It would have to go over 50% for the board not to have a choice."Premier League clubs agree new cost controlsThe 20 Premier League clubs have agreed, in principle, to introduce radical new cost controls.There are two main proposals on the table - a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bills by each season.Club chief executives have now been asked to produce detailed plans for exactly how these proposals will work.These rules would mark a major change for the clubs, which made cumulative losses of �361m in 2010-11.Champions Manchester City, for example, made a �97.9m loss in their latest set of results, which were revealed last Friday.City and Fulham are the only clubs opposed to any spending controls, BBC Sport understands. However, any new Premier League rule requires the approval of only 14 of the 20 clubs in order to be introduced.With the Premier League's new three-year television deals expected to break through the �5bn barrier from 2013, momentum is growing to find a way of preventing the majority of that cash going straight to players and agents.There have now been six meetings of top-flight chairmen where cost controls have been discussed without any concrete decisions being made.The next meeting will be on 6 February.Why TV is the key to Real successWhy do Real Madrid and Barcelona have higher revenues than any English club? The answer lies in the way they sell television rights to their domestic fixtures.The Spanish system allows them to negotiate their own broadcasting deals. In many other countries the TV deals are negotiated by the league they play in, and the money is distributed according to an agreed formula.As winners of the English Premier League, Manchester United received �52m from the distribution of TV rights in 2008/9.Real Madrid - second in La Liga - earned more than double that amount from its broadcasting contract with Mediapro.According to the sports unit at consultants Deloitte, both Real Madrid and Barcelona have deals with Mediapro until at least 2012/13 which will contribute broadcasting revenues of, on average, approximately 150m euros ($203m; �136m) each year.UnequalIn England the distribution of TV money is unequal. But it is a lot less unequal than in Spain.For example, Manchester City, who came tenth in the 2008/9 season received �40m - only �12m less than winners United.And this way of distributing money has helped seven English clubs into Deloitte's list of the 20 highest-earning clubs in the world. Spain has the top two, but no other Spanish club makes the top 20.The attraction of more equal distribution is that it should help produce a more competitive domestic league.So far this season, both Real Madrid and Barcelona have won 19 out of 23 games in La Liga.In England, Chelsea and Manchester United have both won 19 out of 28.So watching an English Premier League game has offered viewers a better chance of watching something other than the routine destruction of less well resourced clubs.DangersWith international TV rights becoming an increasingly important source of income and leagues competing for attention around the world, the Spanish model has clear dangers.In the long run, re-distribution of revenues to help the less well supported clubs should produce a more competitive and watchable league.The merits of a more re-distributive system are about to be put to the test. In Italy the clubs are about to move from a system where clubs sell TV rights individually to a more collective arrangement.As the Deloitte Sports Unit warns in its annual report on football finance, that may pose problems for clubs like Juventus.Its 28,000-seat stadium is a third of the size of some of the other big European clubs. And with that limit on ticket sales, Juve gets almost two thirds of its total revenue from its lucrative domestic television deal.A more even distribution of Italian TV revenues is an obvious threat. But the argument is that making collective arrangements will increase total revenues and make Serie A into a stronger league.As most football fans now know, it is the business arrangements behind the scenes which often drive what happens on the field. And very often, TV is the key.Premiership stays on BBCThe BBC has won the rights to show Premier League highlights from 2007 until 2010.It means Match of the Day will continue on BBC One on Saturday nights and MOTD2 on Sundays for another four seasons."This is the best possible news for us ahead of the World Cup," said Roger Mosey, the BBC's Head of Sport."As well has having the World Cup until 2014, we now have every Premiership goal and all the main action free to people in the UK until 2010."The BBC had submitted a bid of �171.6m for the three-year period.Premier League Chief Executive Richard Scudamore said: "The BBC and Match of the Day have been almost synonymous with our great competition since it started."This deal allows fans to continue to access its high-quality coverage through to the next decade. We are very pleased at the outcome."The deal also gives our clubs the opportunity to showcase their football to the wide and varied audience that the BBC attracts."The market for the highlights rights was very competitive and we were extremely impressed by other proposals."However, we now look forward to extending the great relationship we have with the BBC, one that goes further than this rights deal."The BBC lost the rights to show Premiership highlights to ITV in 2000, but regained them in 2003 for �105m.Dominic Coles, the BBC's director of sports rights and finance, said: "The Premier League is the world's most successful domestic tournament and their rights are the most significant sports rights in the UK. So we're delighted that we will remain their key partner on terrestrial television."The Premier League has been issuing various rights packages for the period from 2007 to 2010.Irish pay-TV firm Setanta broke BSkyB's monopoly of live Premier League football matches by winning the rights to show 46 matches per season from 2007.BSkyB was given 92 live matches, including the "A" package of games on late Sunday afternoons.Other Premiership rights, including mobile rights and overseas rights are still to be determined.Match of the Day first appeared on BBC Television on 22 August 1964.Premiership in new �625m TV dealThe winner of football's Premiership will net �50m from next season after the league agreed a new �625m deal for overseas television rights.The extra income from the deal means even the team finishing bottom will claim about �26m. Current title holders Chelsea won �30m last season.The money adds to income from domestic broadcast and internet contracts."This deal really does take us on to another level," said Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore.Overseas appealThe new contract covers coverage of the 2007/8, 2008/9 and 2009/10 seasons in 208 countries worldwide.The �625m raised is double that from existing overseas television deals and takes the Premiership's earnings from media rights over the three seasons to more than �2.7bn.Mr Scudamore said the largest increase in payments for rights had been in the Middle East and in Asia, with the battle to show live games particularly fierce in Hong Kong."We have a cosmopolitan approach to players and a cosmopolitan approach to ownership and that is paying off," he said."No territories have gone down but in some cases the rights have ended up being sold for three or four times the current amount."Rights dividedBSkyB and Setanta are sharing the domestic television rights for Premiership matches from next season.The rivals were successful bidders in an auction to show top-flight games, beginning in the 2007/8 season.The domestic TV rights auction generated �1.7bn ($3.1bn) for the Premier League, with BSkyB paying �1.3bn for its four packages of games and Setanta �392m for its two.Setanta broke Sky's monopoly and has rights to 46 live matches a season, while BSkyB has won the rights to 92 live matches, including the "A" package of games on late Sunday afternoons.The Premiership's appeal overseas has gone from strength to strength, thanks to high-profile players and the league's reputation for excitement."By focusing on the quality of the game, their players and their grounds, the clubs have produced a competition that people want to watch - both at matches and at home," added Mr Scudamore."That is the basis of our commercial success and I am confident that we will continue to invest in the best players and facilities to keep the Premier League where it is today - the most watched domestic football competition in the world."606 DEBATE: The cash keeps coming but what's the cost for English football?BBC sports editor Mihir Bose said that the big winners of the new deal would be top-flight players and their agents, with supporters and lower league sides unlikely to see any real benefits.Richard Hunter, of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, added that extra money for the Premiership could potentially widen the gap between the top flight and the Championship."If you have the teams who are getting relegated from the Premiership pocketing �30m then in modern day terms that equates to three to five top players," he told BBC News 24."Presumably, if they can replace half their team, that gives them a very good chance of getting promoted again and the gap between the Premiership and the Championship may become wider."Premier League clubs benefit from new overseas TV dealNext season's Premier League champions stand to pick up at least �60m in television and prize money, with top-flight clubs guaranteed at least �40m.With a new overseas TV rights deals for 2010-2013 worth more than �1bn, clubs will receive �7-8m extra each season.Parachute payments made to relegated teams will rise from �11.2m to �16m from the end of this season.That change has raised fears in the Championship that relegated top-flight clubs will have an unfair advantage.Doncaster chairman John Ryan told BBC Radio 5 live last week: "What are the Premier League trying to do to the Championship? Make it a bit more like the Premiership where everybody knows who will finish in the top four before the season starts."It's skewed enough as it is. Look at the table with Newcastle and West Brom at the top. Newcastle's wage bill is �42m and our's is �6m."We are competing because we have a great manager, as do Swansea while Nottm Forest have spent a fortune."If this goes ahead it will really skew the league. It's the best league around because it's so wonderfully unpredictable.And Ryan also expressed his concern that the financial gap would also widen between the Championship and League One and Two clubs."There is an imbalance between Championship and League One and League Two," added Ryan. "I just hope they look at the ramifications."Rather than give massive payments to the relegated clubs, maybe it would be better to spread between the other clubs - it would make it a better competition".In recent years clubs that have been relegated from the Premier League have struggled managing their finances if they fail to win promotion back to the top-flight immediately.In January Crystal Palace became the latest former Premier League club to be placed in administration, joining the likes of Leeds United, Southampton and Leicester City to have suffered a similar fate.And with Cardiff City, Southend United and Bournemouth all fighting winding up orders from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs this season, finances outside the top flight are getting tighter.The domestic Premier League TV deal for 2010-2013 is worth �1.782bn compared to �1.7bn for the current three-year period which expires at the end of the current campaign.Clubs have been told they will receive similar sums from domestic rights for the 2010-2011 campaign with increases for the following seasons.Each place in the Premier League table is worth around �750,000 with a �13.9m payment to each club and 'facility fees' of �480,000 for each televised match (with a minimum of 10 per club).BBC renews Match of the Day dealThe BBC has agreed a new deal to broadcast Premier League highlights until the end of the 2015-16 season.The current deal had been scheduled to expire at the end of next season but a three-year extension has been signed.The rights cover the Saturday evening Match of the Day programme, the Sunday morning repeat, MOTD2 on Sunday evenings and other evenings when Premier League fixtures justify a show.The programmes will be available on the BBC's iPlayer from midnight on MondaysPremier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, said: "The free-to-air highlights are extremely important to the broadcast reach of the Premier League; allowing the competition and our clubs to be seen by the maximum possible number of fans across the country."The BBC has done a fantastic job for fans of Premier League clubs by providing quality coverage and analysis across their programmes."BBC director of sport Barbara Slater added: "We've seen audiences for MOTD grow in recent years and the programme remains one of the BBC's best loved and most iconic brands."The new contract will see MOTD celebrate its 50th birthday."The BBC retained the rights with a bid of �179.7m.The first ever Match of the Day was broadcast on 22 August 1964 and top-flight rights have switched between BBC and ITV since then.Premier League highlights returned to Match of the Day in 2004-05.The show is hosted by former England striker Gary Lineker, with Alan Hansen, Mark Lawrenson and Alan Shearer among the regular pundits.Premier League TV rights: Sky and BT pay �5.1bn for live gamesSky and BT Sport have paid a record �5.136bn for live Premier League TV rights for three seasons from 2016-17.The figure represents a 70% increase on Sky and BT's current �3bn deal.It is unclear whether the increase will affect ticket prices, although Sky pundits and former England internationals Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville said prices should be cut.The Premier League said �56m a year has been earmarked for grassroots projects, including 50 artificial pitches.Under the new contract, 168 games will be shown live, at an average cost to the broadcasters of �10.2m per match.Sky paid �4.176bn to show 126 matches per season, including the first ever Friday evening games and both Sunday packages.BT paid �960m for 42 games per season - four more than its present deal.Pundits and politicians clamoured for the rise in revenue to be passed down to fans and grassroots football.The BBC's Price of Football survey showed that the average price of cheapest tickets in England has risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011.Play mediaJump media playerMedia player helpOut of media player.

I don't think it is inevitable but I have heard people in the industry predict that the next time around [in 2010] the overseas rights will match those domestically. You only have to look at the world population to see the potential for growth."Premier League games are broadcast to 600 million homes in 202 countries across Europe, Asia, Australasia, Oceania, Africa, the Americas and the Middle East. And, after doubling the value of those rights this year to �625 million, there is a feeling they could eventually be worth more than the �1.7 billion currently being paid for the domestic rights by Sky and Setanta.The vast potential only underlines the likelihood of more foreign ownership of Premier League clubs and of kick-off times eventually being changed to suit fans abroad. The huge audience for Saturday's lunchtime match was boosted by it being screened during the evening across the Far East.The broadcaster for much of the Asian market is ESPN Star Sports, the media giant jointly owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Walt Disney.Between now and Christmas, Liverpool and Arsenal will play just one match each at 3pm on a Saturday, while Chelsea and Manchester United will play at the traditional time twice apiece. The recent NFL game at Wembley has also opened eyes to the idea of playing domestic matches in different countries.The Premier League are well aware of the interest abroad, but reject any suggestion that the game could get taken away from the traditional supporter."It is the whole package which is popular," a spokesman said, "the quality on the pitch, state-of-the-art stadiums as well as the fact that so many nations are represented by the players. But it is also important to remember that one of the biggest selling points of the league is full stadiums and the passionate support of fans in England. That remains the cornerstone of the league."Super Sports Media Group acquires Premier League rights in ChinaThe Premier League is pleased to announce that Super Sports Media Group has been awarded the exclusive live audio visual broadcast rights for all 380 Barclays Premier League matches per season for seasons 2013/14-2018/19 in mainland China and Macau."We have worked with Super Sports Media Group for the last two years and are extremely pleased to extend our partnership until 2019," said Premier League Chief Executive, Richard Scudamore."They will continue to deliver a premium offering that will showcase the Barclays Premier League to our many fans in mainland China and Macau.""The main reason for agreeing a six-year partnership with Super Sports is our recognition of their innovative and successful business model and that their coverage and reach makes our matches available to fans in all provinces across mainland China and Macau."Mr. Jianguang Li, board member of Super Sports Media Group also said: "The Premier League has developed a profound understanding of the sports broadcasting market in China and we are very pleased to have formed this long-term partnership with them."This agreement demonstrates the Premier League's strong commitment towards China and Chinese football fans. It will further increase the Premier League's profile in China and give them the opportunity to make it one of their fastest growing markets."English Premier League gets a big American stage on NBCIn the fall of 1991, at age 17, Arlo White traveled from his home in England to visit an uncle and aunt on the South Side of Chicago. He was aching to watch soccer.�I was flipping through what seemed like an endless amount of television channels,� NBC�s lead soccer voice recalled last week. �I was somewhere in the 300s and suddenly saw [Manchester United�s] Ryan Giggs thrashing in a volley. I was overjoyed that I managed to find this little snippet.�Two decades later, neither White nor anyone else with a soccer itch in the United States will have any such trouble finding Premier League matches � or, for that matter, seeing Giggs, who this weekend entered his 24th season with Manchester United.Once relegated to specialty channels or presented on tape delay at odd hours, English soccer is now more accessible than ever in the United States. After obtaining the rights to Premier League matches in a three-year, $250 million deal, NBC will utilize a variety of platforms to carry all 380 Premier League matches each season.The network typically will show three matches live on Saturdays (two on NBC Sports Network, the network�s cable channel, and one on NBC), two on Sundays and one on Mondays (all on NBCSN) through the nine-month campaign. Coverage will also appear on three other properties: CNBC, Spanish-language Telemundo and mun2, a bilingual channel geared toward young viewers.Games not available on standard outlets will appear on overflow channels at no charge to cable and satellite subscribers who receive NBCSN. (Many, but not all, systems are participating.) NBC Sports Live Extra, the network�s online streaming service, will provide coverage of every match for desktops, tablets and mobile devices.�People in the United States have been begging and dying for this kind of coverage,� NBC coordinating producer Pierre Moossa said.Ratings will tell whether that claim is true. One thing is certain: The Premier League, regarded as one of the most popular global sports brands, has never had an American stage like this before.Last fall, in a surprising outcome, NBC outbid ESPN and Fox, which had held the property for three years at a cost of $80 million, for the rights to televise Premier League games. Fox showed most games on two boutique channels as well as an online pay service and licensed others to ESPN. NBCSN is available in twice as many households as Fox Soccer Channel, which, with the debut of Fox Sports 1 this month, is in the process of being dissolved.Fox Sports 1 will carry the other powerhouse soccer property, the UEFA Champions League, while ESPN and NBC will continue to share Major League Soccer coverage. ESPN also has the 2014 World Cup rights.In all, more than 150 Premier League matches will appear on NBCSN this season and another 20 on NBC � mainstream visibility for a sport restless to shed its niche reputation in the United States.�I don�t think [soccer has] ever been this popular,� said White, who handled play-by-play for the Seattle Sounders of MLS for two years before moving to NBC�s MLS coverage in 2012. �Is it a tipping point? We�ll have to wait and see. I just know there is a huge amount of following of the game in the United States.�That following has translated into strong ratings for high-profile competitions, such as the World Cup, Women�s World Cup and Champions League. The largest weekly U.S. audience is for the Mexican league, carried primarily by Univision�s family of Spanish-language channels.NBC will attempt to hook viewers by chronicling the rhythms of a European season: the expectations surrounding glamour clubs Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City; the challenges facing traditional sides such as Liverpool and Arsenal; the battles to avoid relegation to the second-tier league; and the chase for Champions League slots.More than 600 hours of studio shows and original programming will augment the match coverage.Americans, �when they are traveling out of the U.S., see what this game is doing to the rest of the world,� studio host Rebecca Lowe said. �Perhaps they are starting to think they want a piece of that.�NBC is promoting Premier League coverage as if it�s the NFL: New York subway trains wrapped in ads, splashy billboards in Manhattan and TV spots featuring comedic actor Jason Sudeikis as �Ted Lasso,� an American football coach hired to guide London�s Tottenham Hotspur. (�My job just got a lot easier: no ties or playoffs,� he says.)Among NBC�s challenges is introducing the league to casual viewers without insulting sophisticated fans. Last week, the soccer community mocked NBC�s Premier League primer on Twitter that included, �No points are given for a loss.�As for game-day production, the network is promising a straightforward approach.�We just want to cover the sport the way it deserves to be covered,� Moossa said. �We have a very intelligent fan base here in the United States, so we�re not going to get into dumbing down the game as much as focusing on covering all aspects of the game � as you would in the U.K., as you would if it were any other sport. The fans are going to enjoy the game being treated properly.�NBC wins $250m rights to broadcast English Premier League in USNBC's network will broadcast every EPL game for three years from 2013-14 after outbidding Fox and ESPNNBC's network will televise the English Premier League under a $250 million, three-year deal that begins next season.The network will show every match from the world's most popular soccer league, taking coverage away from Fox and ESPN."The Barclays Premier League is the pre-eminent soccer league in the world, and is on the cusp of exponential popularity growth here in the U.S.," NBC Sports Group chairman Mark Lazarus said Sunday.NBC picked up Major League Soccer last year and had success with its soccer broadcasts during the London Olympics.Criticized for using tape delay with the Olympics because of time differences, NBC will not do so with Premier League games, Lazarus said."We think we're acquiring a set of assets that has unique affluent male appeal that's very attractive to advertisers and attractive to cable operators," Lazarus said.NBC's English-language networks will televise six live games a week. One or two of the company's other cable channels will be used along with NBC Sports Network, Lazarus said, but which ones have not been determined yet as schedules are evaluated. Other games will be streamed live online.The network has been expanding its sports portfolio since cable company Comcast took over NBCUniversal in January 2011, a merger that paired cable sports channel Versus with NBC Sports. Versus was renamed NBC Sports Network at the start of this year.Lazarus has highlighted how live sports events are the best way to grow the channel's audience, but not many properties are available in the short term, and he acknowledges that the incumbents generally have an advantage once negotiations for new contracts start.NBC recently signed a deal for Formula One. But NBC Sports Network's biggest property is the NHL, whose season runs concurrently with English soccer. The EPL will be a good complement to the network's hockey coverage, Lazarus said, adding live soccer games in the morning and afternoon to prime-time NHL broadcasts."It's a younger skewing sport than some others out there, like some that are in a championship series right now," Lazarus said, in apparent reference to Major League baseball and its older viewership.The previous three-year EPL deal with Fox, that saw some matches sublicensed to ESPN, was worth about $80 million.The EPL has sold its TV rights in Britain to BSkyB and BT for �3 billion ($4.86 billion) in a record three-year deal from the 2013-14 season.The EPL said NBC will deliver the "biggest and broadest programming and promotion commitment ever in the United States" for the league."The NBC Sports Group has an excellent track record in sports broadcasting," EPL chief executive Richard Scudamore said.Telemundo and mun2 will show Spanish-language coverage in the U.S.Premier League casualties - clubs that have struggled since relegationIf Charlton find theselves playing League One football next season, they will face some familiar names. The football league is full of teams who have fallen from the big time. Here we look at some of the biggest names to depart the Premier League only to become lost in football ignominy...Charlton AthleticIn Alan Curbishley's 15 years at Charlton, he established the Addicks as a mainstay of the Premier League. At the end of the 2003/04 season, Charlton finished 7th - their highest ever finish. Then Curbs left in 2006. Two-and-a half-years later and Charlton are on their forth manager, and sitting bottom of the Championship.Leeds UnitedLeeds United are without doubt the strongest team ever to have fallen by the Premier League wayside. Under David O'Leary, Leeds never finished outside of the top five, and were also a force in Europe, reaching the semi-finals of the 2001 Champions League. It was there that everything seemed to fall apart. Despite having lots of talent, the club was the victim of some catastrophic financial decisions, made under chairman Peter Ridsdale, forcing the sale of the majority of their squad, the training facilities and even their ground. In 2004 they were relegated from the Premier League, and in 2007 were demoted to the third tier of English football - where they still languish.Nottingham ForestForest's success during Brian Clough's 18-year-reign is the stuff of legend. Old Big 'Ead made Forest one of the finest teams in the land, winning promotion to the First Division, two European Cups, a League Cup, not to mention reaching an FA Cup final and UEFA Cup semi-final. Sadly for Cloughy, his final season at the club saw Forest relegated from the Premier League. However, under Frank Clark Forest returned to the top flight before spending several years yo-yoing between the two divisions. Forest were eventually relegated from the Premier League for the final time in May 1999. Six years later they became the only European Cup-winners ever to fall into the third division of domestic football.Leicester CityAlthough Leicester had been in the Premier League for a season before his arrival, Martin O'Neill's time at Leicester was the most successful in the club's history. Under O'Neill, the Foxes had four top 10 finishes and won the League Cup twice. They also qualified for Europe and became an established team in the top flight. However, as is so often the case, when O'Neill left for Celtic in 2000 Leicester struggled. Huge financial problems saw them lose many of their best players and after a few seasons of hanging in there, they were relegated to the Championship and ultimately to League One.Bradford CityAs newcomers to the Premier League in 1999, Bradford were hotly tipped for relegation. One pundit however, took it a stage further. Rodney Marsh, with his usual degree of brash certainty, said that if they stayed up he would shave all his hair off, which they did thanks to a 1-0 win against Liverpool. Marsh, being a good sport, honoured the bet and had his blond locks removed. Sadly their last-gasp survival in 2000 was about as good as it got for the Bantams as they were relegated the following year. In the seasons that followed, Bradford struggled financially due to the collapse of ITV digital and overspending and went into administration in 2002. The club managed to stay afloat (despite a second period of administration) but were relegated to League One in 2004 and then to the fourth tier of English football in 2007, a place where they remain to this day. Ask any Bradford fan whether lavish spending on the likes of Benito Carbone and David Hopkin was worth it and you're likely to get a shake of the head.It's official - Tottenham have the worst defence in Premier League historyTottenham have the worst defensive record in the history of the Premier League.

They are all due to compete in major contests next season."It is now up to English football to put its house in order," said Mr Croker outside Number 10.Mr Millichip acknowledged the ban was a pre-emptive move and that Uefa (the Union of European Football Associations) would have imposed it anyway."It was very important that the FA took positive action and immediately," he said, saying it was the most difficult decision he had ever had to take.The Labour leader of the Opposition, Neil Kinnock, said the ban of English teams would only benefit those who caused the "murderous riot" in Belgium.The Football League which was not consulted is also opposed to the decision.The Belgian government has already banned all British clubs from its territory until further notice.Liverpool, whose fans were blamed for much of the violence, had decided to pull out of next season's Uefa cup competition before the FA announcement.Vorm is man in form to save SwansThere was no doubting Swansea's belief, on the occasion of the historic first Premier League match to be played outside of England, that they belong in the big-time. "Cyril's gone Premier," it was announced when their famous fluffy swan appeared and the obligatory Max Boyce appearance delivered an updated rendition of "Hymns and Arias" � an anthem generally preserved for the national side.But the club's deep dependence already on a �1.5m goalkeeper signed from Utrecht � whose penalty save prevented this occasion becoming far removed from the Bob Latchford hat-trick heroics which took Swansea to the top of the First Division when they last arrived in the promised land 30 years ago � is evident already.Michel Vorm's save from Ben Watson's weak spot-kick followed on from his 11 saves in a 4-0 defeat at Manchester City last Monday: evidence that, even at this formative stage of their top-flight return, Swansea's immaculate ball playing is nowhere near enough. Watson's miss, in a five minute period which saw Jordi Gomez and Victor Moses find the woodwork, left Roberto Martinez understandably disconsolate last night. "When you miss the penalty and you hit the crossbar and the post you think yes, you should have won it," he said. "If you play that game 10 times you are going to win it more than you lose it and draw," said the Wigan manager.Martinez, the man who took over a shambolic, relegation-threatened Swansea whose routine was "to train and then go over to Tesco for an all-day breakfast" � as their defender Alan Tate remembered his arrival as manager yesterday � was not subjected to the expected vitriol by Swansea's fans, who have never forgiven him for departing to Wigan.But for half an hour, the Spaniard cannot have failed to be a little haunted by the comparison between his former charges, playing the seamless, passing football he introduced them to, and his present side, who lacked the individuals to provide the same. Danny Graham had three chances in the first 15 minutes alone and it took a fine sliding challenge from Gary Caldwell to prevent Wayne Routledge scoring after Scott Sinclair put him through. The composed midfield intelligence of Leon Britton and Nathan Dyer, a Martinez signing, playing "back to front" as Martinez had always urged them, suggested that one of these two clubs had kicked on more than the other since Martinez headed north in May 2009.Routledge, whose arrival from Newcastle looks like a very good piece of business, teased the ball out of Manuel Figueroa's reach and shot inches wide of Ali Al Habsi's right post. But Wigan, who had been sitting deep and showing minimal ambition, hurt Swansea when they began to advance. In the space of three minutes, Moses raced into the left hand side of the area and forced a sharp save from Vorm, Gomez lifted an elegant shot against the bar and Moses exposed Steven Caulker to fire against the post.It was amid this m�l�e that Gomez, Wigan's outstanding player on his return to his old club, was clipped by Ashley Williams as he ran into the penalty area.Martinez said he had not seen Watson, who converted against Swansea in last season's Carling Cup win, miss a penalty but his shot to Vorm's right lacked power and the save was a comfortable one. Swansea's manager,Brendan Rodgers, later revealed that basic research into Watson's penalties showed he preferred to shoot right. The Carling Cup kick and last week's goal against Norwich were both dispatched that way."We created chances, which was good to see," Rodgers added. But early signs suggest Swansea will need to be a little less welcoming to visitors, this seasonSwansea City (4-2-3-1): Vorm; Rangel, Caulker, Williams, Taylor; Agustien, Britton (Allen, 75); Dyer, Routledge (Dobbie, 75) Sinclair; Graham (Lita, 84).Wigan Athletic (4-4-2): Al Habsi; Boyce, Caldwell, Alcaraz (Stam, 37), Figueroa; Watson; Gomez, McCarthy (McArthur, 65), Diame, Moses; Di Santo (Rodallega, 70).Referee Phil Dowd.Man of the match Routledge (Swansea).Match rating 7/10.Uefa give Swansea and Cardiff European assuranceWelsh clubs Swansea City and Cardiff City have been told by Uefa the only way they can qualify for Europe is by representing the English league.Swansea and Cardiff are among six Welsh clubs in the English system and there had been uncertainty they could qualify for Europe via the English pyramid.But both have been given assurances by European football's governing body.Uefa's executive committee have ruled Welsh clubs in an English league cannot qualify for Europe via the Welsh Cup.This means Swansea can play in Europe if they finish in the Premier League's Europa League places.Uefa, though, did reject the Football Association of Wales' request to give their six exiled clubs a promise of European football through the Welsh Cup.Uefa's two-day executive committee meeting in Istanbul has finally clarified that Swansea, Cardiff or any of the Welsh clubs would qualify for Europe should they finish high enough in the English top flight or by winning the FA or League Cups."Welsh clubs, like Swansea and Cardiff, will be able to qualify for European competition through the English system," confirmed a Uefa spokesman.The Swans are eighth in their first Premier League season, just 10 points behind fifth-placed Chelsea, while Cardiff were FA Cup finalists in 2008 as well as 2012 League Cup finalists.Clubs that finish fifth in the Premier League will definitely qualify for the Europa League but if the FA Cup final is between two clubs in the top five, a sixth-place top-flight finish will then earn a Europa League spot.Swansea could also earn Europa League qualification through the Fair Play League but only if the English league is in the top three national associations in the Uefa Fair Play ranking.Tottenham Hotspur currently lead the Premier League's fair play table but if Spurs, who are third in the Premier League, qualify for the Champions League, a possible Europa League place would go to the team second in that table which is currently Swansea.However, the Premier League seems unlikely to earn a Fair Play European place this season.Uefa's ruling is a blow to the Welsh FA who wanted to offer Welsh clubs competing in the English league pyramid, also including Wrexham, Newport County, Colwyn Bay and Merthyr Town, the carrot of Europa League qualification to persuade them to play in the Welsh Cup.Newport, Wrexham and Merthyr entered this season's Welsh Cup but their participation in future Welsh Cups may now be in some doubt without the lure of European qualification.Wrexham, winners of the Welsh Cup a record 23 times, beat Cardiff 2-1 in 1995 in the last Welsh Cup final involving Wales' English league clubs.Wales' exiled clubs had been barred from entering the competition since 1995 when Uefa initially insisted only clubs from the Welsh league system were eligible to represent Wales in Europe."We accept the decision and as an association we'll move on to strengthen the profile of the competition as it exists at the moment," said FAW spokesman Ian Gwyn Hughes."I think everybody would accept since the likes of Cardiff and Swansea ceased playing in the Welsh Cup the profile has dropped."But it's up to us as an association working with those clubs to improve the strength and the profile of the competition within the clubs that play in it."Rolling Stones to return to Hyde ParkThe Rolling Stones are to perform in London's Hyde Park for the first time since a legendary free concert for an estimated 250,000 people in 1969.The outdoor gig will take place on 6 July, a week after the group's first appearance at the Glastonbury festival.The rock legends famously played in the park just two days after death of guitarist Brian Jones in July 1969."It seems like yesterday," guitarist Keith Richards told the BBC. "It's going to be a great summer, man."He added: "All the gigs we haven't done or wanted to redo are popping up."At the first Hyde Park gig, Mick Jagger wore a white dress on stage and read a Percy Bysshe Shelley poem dedicated to Jones. Thousands of butterflies were then released into the air."I'll try and keep the poetry to a minimum," Sir Mick told the BBC's Colin Paterson about their return. He did reveal that he still owns the dress, adding: "I can still just about get into the zippers."Unlike in 1969, this year's show will not be free - but ticket prices have not been announced. The group angered some fans when they charged up to �406 for shows at the O2 arena last year.The Hyde Park show - part of Barclaycard Presents British Summer Time Hyde Park - will come a week after the Stones headline the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury.Sir Mick said he would phone U2 singer Bono for advice following the Irish band's 2011 performance. "'Don't do it!' might be his advice, but it's a bit late for that," Sir Mick joked."It is quite a difficult gig," he added. "U2 had terrible weather and that didn't help. You have to learn from their experiences."Bono later said the band gave a disappointing performance at the festival because they were "a bit freaked out" by the conditions and the singer wore the "wrong shoes" for the stage.The Stones have also announced a North American tour, beginning in May, but with more recovery time between gigs than in previous years."You gotta pace yourself," the 69-year-old singer said. "We have enough time before we come back to England, so we'll be well recovered."But he said the group had no current plans to tour the rest of the world.They will be supported in Hyde Park in July by The Vaccines, The Temper Trap and Gary Clark Jr.Samsung Galaxy S5: Camera Hardware ExplainedSamsung Galaxy S5: Camera HardwareThe Samsung Galaxy S5 has a 16-megapixel sensor and f/2.2 lens with a equivalent focal length of 31mm. The Galaxy S4 has a 13-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 lens, and initially the new model seems like a pretty uninspired upgrade. This continues when we look at the size of the camera sensors.The Galaxy S5 sensor is bigger than the S4's � �.6 inches to the S4's 1/3.06 inches. However, all this means is the new phone can get to a higher resolution without reducing the size of the sensor pixels. Both the S4 and S5 have 1.12 micron sensor pixels. That's pretty small, and the size of these pixels has a big hand in low-light performance.Don't care about the Galaxy S5's camera hardware? Skip straight to S5 camera image quality.ISOCELL sensorThis sensor is much more of a step forward than you might initially assume, though � both technically and politically. The Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S4 both used Sony camera sensors, but the Galaxy S5 uses a new Samsung-made sensor featuring ISOCELL tech.Samsung offers loads of highly technical information about ISOCELL on its website, but it revolves around a new sensor architecture that creates a physical barrier between sensor pixels to lower crosstalk. This will let the Galaxy S5 use higher ISO sensitivity settings without introducing too much image noise. Samsung's claim is that crosstalk is down by 30 per cent. We are not CCD engineers at TrustedReviews, but it appears to make good tech sense.There's another innovation in the Galaxy S5, too. It is the first phone to use phase detection focusing as well as contrast detection.Hybrid Auto FocusContrast detection is used by all other mobile phone camera AF systems, and it analyses the contrast in areas of an image to attain a solid focus. In-focus objects will always offer higher contrast than the smushy out-of-focus ones. It's a system that's blissfully easy to explain in a basic manner, and most high-end phones now offer excellent contrast detection systems � the iPhone 5S's is a particularly notable star.Phase detection is a good deal more complicated, mostly because it requires separate hardware and is implemented in various ways in different kinds of cameras. Traditionally in DSLRs a slightly translucent mirror is used to divert some of the light away from the image sensor to a separate PDAF (phase detection autofocus) module.However, with the Galaxy S5 we get a mirror-free on-sensor phase detection autofocus system. As a concept this is nothing brand new, having been used in a smattering of compact, bridge and compact system cameras since 2010. The first camera to use this technology was the FujiFilm FinePix F300EXR.What is Phase Detect autofocus?To understand phase detection you have to look into the basics physics of the camera system a bit. The light that reaches the Galaxy S5's image sensor is passed through a series of six plastic lens elements, and they are curved. When the focusing element isn't in the right place, the light from the extreme left and right (or top/bottom) ends of the front lens element will not reach a point of convergence on the sensor.What phase detection does is to separate out the light received from these extreme ends of the lens and compares them to see how out of whack � or out of phase � they are. Although Samsung hasn't explained this in official documentation yet, the PDAF layer that sits in front of the image sensor will feature a series of microlenses that separate out this specific 'left' and 'right' information for comparison.The focusing element is then simply moved until the information from the two ends of the lens is correct, signalling the image is in focus.The most obvious question � why is phase detection better than contrast detection? If you've looked into the Galaxy S5's autofocus yourself, you'll probably have heard the frustrating generic 'it's faster and more accurate'. However, the systems both have their limitations.The issue with contrast detection is that the system has to go slightly beyond the point of focus and then 'track back' in order to know that it was indeed the point of highest contrast. If you have a good phone, you may not even have noticed this 'back and forth' focusing. But it does happen, and it is what slows contrast detection down a little bit.Contrast detection also has trouble in finding focus on objects � you guessed it � that don't have much contrast to speak of. However, in our experience dedicated camera contrast detect systems have much more notable issues with this than top phones. It maybe down to phones having to make up for their tiny lenses and tiny sensors with clever software.An issue with on-sensor phase detection is that it relies on specific microlenses that sit above the sensor. So the points of focus available to the system are limited.Handily (sarcasm), Samsung has not confirmed how many phase detection focus points there are, or any specific details of how the PDAF system works. But hopefully we've given you an overview of the matter.On the next page we'll see how it works in action.Samsung confirms fatal camera flaw on 'limited number' of Galaxy S5 smartphonesThe Samsung Galaxy S5's 16-megapixel camera is one of its best assets, but it's also turned into something of a liability for the company just weeks after launch. Complaints across internet forums have documented a major flaw with the camera on some devices � particularly the Verizon Wireless model � that renders the shooter useless.According to reports, a "camera failure" error has been randomly popping up for some new owners. There's no obvious cause behind the bug, but once the error is received, the camera hardware becomes permanently disabled. Users have taken afflicted S5 phones back to carrier stores and Samsung's own specialty sections at Best Buy in hopes of bringing the camera back to life, but only a physical exchange for a new device has remedied the problem so far.Samsung has now confirmed that it's aware of the reports and is actively trying to assist impacted customers. In a statement, a company spokesperson told The Verge, "We have learned that a limited number of Galaxy S5 devices may have an issue that causes 'Camera Failure' pop-up error message." S5 owners with a busted camera are asked to call 1-888-987-4357 to arrange an exchange under Samsung's warranty, or they can visit their respective carrier for a swap. Verizon is also doing its part to spread the message, as seen below. The complaints haven't swelled to a crisis quite yet, so you probably shouldn't let the early hiccup sway you away from Samsung's flagship if you were planning to purchase it.Samsung hopes its Galaxy S5 is the picture of healthOf the seemingly hundreds of phone models produced by Samsung each year, none are more important to the Korean phone maker than the Galaxy S series. Samsung�s flagship series crams all the latest hardware and software into a phone that has a halo effect for all mobile things carrying the Samsung label.The Galaxy SIII and S4 have been blockbuster sales hits, and we expect no less from the Galaxy S5. And now, after months of rumors and leaked specs, the GS5 is official. Samsung�s new flagship phone is coming on April 11. What does it have in store for us?The specsLet�s cut to the chase. What did Samsung pack inside their its flagship phone?Size: 5.6 x 2.8 x 0.31 inchesWeight: 5.1 ouncesProcessor: 2.5 GHz quad-core processorDisplay: 5.1-inch Super AMOLED, 1920 x 1080 (~430 ppi)OS: Android 4.4.2 KitKat (with Samsung�s latest TouchWiz on top)RAM: 2GBStorage: 16/32GB, with MicroSD slot up to 128GBCameras: 2.1 megapixels up front, 16 megapixels on the rear cameraVideo: Ultra HD @ 30fps, HDR, and video stabilizationWireless: LTE Cat.4, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, NFC, IRBattery: 2800 mAhSmall improvements in core hardwareThis is a cutting-edge phone, as expected. It�s a little larger and a little heavier than the Galaxy S4, but not much. It doesn�t look dramatically different from the GS4, with one major exception�the back features a perforated texture that should give it a much nicer feel than the basic, slick plastic on last year�s model.One place the rumor mill got the story very wrong is in predicting a quad-HD display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. Instead, the Galaxy S5 will sport a more pedestrian 1920 x 1080 full-HD screen. At 5.1 inches, just a hair bigger than the GS4, that gives you a similar pixel density of 430ppi.Samsung promises improvements, including local contrast enhancement, which measuring the ambient light and adjusts the display accordingly, to maintain visibility even in bright outdoor light.The processor powering the phone wasn�t mentioned by name, only that it is a �2.5 GHz quad-core� processor. Our guess is that this is probably a Snapdragon 801 or 805. That�s a decent step up from the Snapdragon 600 in the Galaxy S4, but it�s not a big leap over other top-end Android phones. The 2GB of RAM it�s rockin� is also de rigeur in a premium Android phone.The battery has been boosted from 2600mAh to 2800mAh, still not very impressive compared to the biggest-battery phones on the market. Samsung promises 10 hours of web browsing and 12 hours of video playback, but it�s best to take specs like that with a grain of salt. Frankly, we were hoping for a 3000mAh battery or better.A feature called Ultra Power Saving Mode sounds like a nice software innovation similar to what we�ve seen on Lumia devices. It turns the screen black and white, and kills all tasks except the essentials like texts and phone calls. Even with just a little battery life left, Samsung promises huge standby time in this mode. Call it peace of mind when you�re not near a charger and still want to get that emergency call.Focus on the cameraThe 16-megapixel rear camera is a point of pride for Samsung�s new flagship phone. A new fast autofocus mode combines traditional autofocus and phase detection autofocus. It can lock in a shot in 0.3 seconds, Samsung claims. This is a big deal�the camera on the GS4 is high-res, but quite slow, and suffers from annoying focus problems. A new HDR mode allows for much faster HDR shots, and can even take HDR video. Speaking of video, there�s support for shooting ultra-HD at up to 30 frame per second, and digital stabilization, too.Water and dust resistantIt looks like there will be no �Galaxy S5 Active� variant, as there was with the GS4. This time, the Galaxy S5 features IP67 water and dust resistance, just like the GS4 Active, in the base model.Swipe your finger, check your pulseThe GS5�s biometric sensors step up from state of the art by including not only a fingerprint scanner but a heartrate monitor as well. The fingerprint sensor lets you unlock your phone, authorize purchases, and unlock Private Mode. That last bit is new�it�s a sandbox for pictures, videos, and apps that you want to hide from anyone else who might use your phone. I guess calling it �porn mode� was too obvious, eh Samsung?On the back of the phone, just beneath the camera, is something we haven�t seen in a smartphone before: a heartrate monitor. I�m not sure how usable it is to stop your workout, pull your five-inch phone out, and hold your finger on one little spot on the back, but it�s a feature that rival phones don�t have. Samsung�s pushing the fitness thing hard, with new software and a renewed focus on fitness tracking it its new Gear wearables.Improved connectivityWith support for LTE Cat.4, Samsung boasts that the GS5 will support LTE �everywhere� and provide the best possible performance. Let�s not count our chickens, though. It�s not uncommon for Samsung to release international versions with broad frequency support, and for U.S. carriers to have slightly different revisions that don�t work with as many frequency bands around the world. We�ll have to wait for more details about regional and carrier variants before breaking out the champagne.Wi-Fi performance on the Galaxy S5 is getting a kick in the pants, too. It�s not support for 802.11 a/b/g/n and ac that excites us, it�s 2x2 MIMO support. That means using a pair of antennas together for enhanced throughput. What�s more, the GS5 will bond both download over both the Wi-Fi and LTE together, offering greatly improved speeds. That�s a neat feature, but with data caps being what they are, we hope it�s something you can easily disable.And lots moreNew Galaxy devices are always packed with little features and changes, and I�m sure we�ll discover a lot more before the Galaxy S5 hits shelves in April. For starters, Samsung hasn�t mentioned a price; we�d be shocked if the phone didn�t cost at least $600. There�s a whole new version of Samsung�s Touchwiz UI to detail, additional software features like Kids Mode, and new features to Samsung�s S-Health app, first introduced last year with the GS4 and now enhanced for its successor. We�ll have more on Samsung�s flagship soon, including a hands-on look at the device.Samsung announces Galaxy S5, launching in the US in AprilSamsung sticks to a proven formula for this year's refresh.BARCELONA, SPAIN�We're live at Mobile World Congress, where Samsung is holding its "Unpacked 5" press event. The company has just announced its newest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5, and it says the new phone will launch in the US in April.Samsung isn't really changing its formula with this new phone, which is very much in the mold of last year's Galaxy S4 and 2012's Galaxy S III. It's still a rounded rectangle made primarily of plastic, and it still has a removable plastic back that conceals a SIM slot and a removable battery. The phone is a little larger than the Galaxy S4, but not as large as a "phablet" like the Galaxy Note 3�leaked comparison shots show the S5 right in between the two. The phone still has a camera, LED flash, and speaker mounted on the back, but the micro-USB 2.0 port in the Galaxy S4 has been exchanged for the same larger, faster micro-USB 3.0 port used in the Note 3. The phone will be offered in black, blue, gold, and white, and more "designer colors" and patterns have been promised for the future. The phone's soft-touch plastic back has a "unique, perforated rear pattern" reminiscent of the 2012 Nexus 7. It should increase the phone's grippiness, a welcome improvement after a couple generations of slippery, smooth plastic.As we expected from the new button layout of the Galaxy NotePro and TabPro, Samsung has finally ditched the legacy Android menu button in favor of the Google-recommended button set of Recent apps, Home, and Back. The buttons are still reversed compared to the standard layout used in Nexus phones�the Back button is to the right of the Home button and Recent Apps is on the left. Both of those are still capacitive buttons built in to the bottom bezel, while Home is a physical button that now integrates a fingerprint sensor. Just as with Apple's TouchID technology in the iPhone 5S, registered fingerprints can be used to unlock the phone and make mobile payments. Fingerprints are reportedly encrypted and stored locally.The S5 is running Android 4.4.2, which is still being skinned with a version of Samsung's TouchWiz. The Settings menu appears to have been reorganized, presenting a grid of icons to tap instead of a list of settings to scroll through. A new Kids Mode will give younger users access to a few games or other apps, letting your kids play with Mom or Dad's phone without deleting all of the important data on it. We'll have to wait to get hands-on time with the phone to see what other tweaks Samsung has made to the software.The phone has a 5.1-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display, slightly larger than last year's Galaxy S4. Samsung says the display can now be set to be "extremely dim" to prevent it from bothering those around you in the dark. It's also one of the first devices to use a Snapdragon 801 from Qualcomm. This "one louder" version of the Snapdragon 800 is architecturally identical, but it comes with faster CPU, GPU, and memory bus speeds, a bone Qualcomm has thrown to OEMs while it finishes up work on the true Snapdragon 800 successor, the 805.The S5 also includes 2GB of RAM, 16 or 32GB of storage that can be expanded with up to 128GB of microSD storage, and a 2800 mAh battery. Samsung promises 10 hours of Web browsing on LTE and 12 hours of video playback on a single charge. It measures 142.0 x 72.5 x 8.1 mm and weighs 145 g, slightly larger and heavier than the Galaxy S4's 136.6 x 69.8 x 7.9 mm and 130 g. It is IP67 dust and water resistant, which should help prevent some damage from dust and dirt.The new phone supports 802.11ac MIMO, which should allow for maximum transfer speeds of up to 867Mbps�many of last year's flagships included single-stream 802.11ac that was capped at 433Mbps. Category 4 LTE from Qualcomm allows LTE speeds of up to 150Mbps down and 50Mbps up, as long as your carrier supports them. Samsung says that its "download booster" technology can use Wi-Fi and LTE simultaneously to provide faster download speeds, though you'll want to be careful not to eat up your monthly data allotment by overusing the feature. Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC are also included, as is an IR blaster for use with television sets.Like many other Galaxy phones, the S5 features compatibility with all of Samsung's wearable devices: the original Galaxy Gear, the new Tizen-based Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo, and the new fitness-focused Gear Fit. The Galaxy S5 also includes some fitness hardware of its own�there's a heart rate sensor located next to the LED flash. Hold your finger over the sensor and it will track your current heart rate.The S5 includes a 16MP rear camera with an LED flash and a 2.0MP front camera for video chatting. The camera features a hybrid autofocus lens and an improved image sensor. The rear camera promises 0.3 second autofocus times and "advanced HDR" capabilities, as well as a new Selective Focus feature that can simulate a lens with a shallow depth-of-field. Samsung says the phone's camera interface has also been revamped.We'll be going hands-on with the phone and putting up more photos and impressions soon. Stay tuned!Hands On With the Samsung Galaxy S5BARCELONA�Samsung's Galaxy S5 steps back just a touch from the UI excess of the Galaxy S4, but Samsung just can't help itself; the phone is packed full of features old and new, especially focused on camera improvements and health tracking. It's still going to be the everything phone.I got to spend some time with the Galaxy S5 in advance of the announcement, and I came away impressed. Here's some of what I saw.Physical Features, Processor and NetworkingThe S5's body isn't its best feature. Let's get that out there. About the same size as the S4 at 5.6 by 2.8 by 0.31 inches (HWD) and 5.1 ounces, it's still plasticy, still bezel-y, with a chintzy chromed plastic edge. Samsung describes it as"modern and glam," but it's going to need to change its materials palette to really get there.The back is now a textured plastic with a stipple pattern, like you find on the Galaxy Note 3. On the bottom, a plug covers the big USB 3.0 port; this phone is water-resistant and can be dunked, Samsung says. On the top, there's a little IR blaster.The screen, on the other hand, is truly beautiful. This is still a 5.1-inch, 432 ppi 1,920-by-1080 Super AMOLED display, very similar to the S4's screen. But Samsung put a custom image chip in here that dynamically adjusts the color gamut and contrast based on ambient light. It's a big step up from the standard automatic brightness control, and it makes the colors really pop under different lighting conditions.Below the screen there's a big home button, and yes, it's a fingerprint scanner. This scanner doesn't just log you in; it can also pay for things with PayPal, and Samsung will have an SDK so third parties can use it for authentication as well. I didn't get to try it.I did get to try the heart-rate monitor, which is on the back next to the camera flash. Rest your finger on it, and it measures your heart rate. It worked within a few seconds, feeding the data into the S Health app.MWC Bug ArtUnder the hood, we have a 2.5GHz, quad-core Qualcomm MSM8974 processor and a lot of new networking technologies. There's 802.11ac with MIMO for very fast Wi-Fi performance, and LTE/Wi-Fi aggregation, which can download the same file over both networks for really fast performance. (If your LTE is capped, you can turn that off.) The LTE modem supports 21 frequency bands, so there's a chance we'll see a common device across several U.S. carriers, like the iPhones.The phone has 2GB of RAM and comes in 16 and 32GB storage models, and yes, there's a MicroSD memory card slot, expandable to 128GB. The battery clocks in at 2,800mAh.Camera and SoftwareThe S5's 16-megapixel main camera is the bit I'm most hoping to check out further. It's very fast; Samsung said it has 0.3-second autofocus, making sharp pictures feel instant. It's also the first phone we've seen with live HDR preview, so you can see what the popular HDR effect will do to your images; it works for videos, too. There's also a 2-megapixel front-facing camera. Like the Galaxy Note 3's camera, this one records 4K video at 30 frames per second.Samsung really simplified the camera modes here, which I found hugely relieving. A whole bunch of them have now been lumped under "Shot & More," while controls for HDR and "selective focus" (blurring the background or foreground) are right on the main shooting screen. The S4's camera was vastly overburdened with modes, so this is a big step forward.Samsung backed off a little on the custom software, but not too far. While this is Android 4.4.2, it's nowhere near stock Android. Let's start with S Health, which will be a big deal this year. It has a pedometer, heart rate tracking, a sleep tracker, blood glucose tracker, activity tracker, and more.There's Easy Mode, which simplifies the interface for older adults, and Kids Mode, which restricts it for young children. The settings screen is customized; ditto the dialer, the contact book, and the calendar. There's no Google Now, but there's still S Voice. My Magazine is Samsung's version of Flipboard; Samsung Apps is still preloaded; at least Samsung Hub, Samsung's lackluster media store is gone.When the phone gets low on power, it drops into a monochrome power-saving mode, which doubles the remaining battery life.So What Do I Think?I really liked the Galaxy S4, in all its excess, and so did a lot of people; it was a big hit. The S5 isn't going to change any minds. I'm excited by the new camera features, the health tracking, and the eye-popping screen. The 2.5GHz processor in here promises glorious performance, and I like touches like Easy Mode, Kids Mode, and the low-power mode. I'm also happy to see Samsung is trying to find some way to use fingerprint ID beyond just unlocking the phone.Check Out the Best Photos From MWC 2014!Samsung phone owners love their phones' features and performance and can overlook the oddly cheap-feeling body materials. No, it isn't made of metal and glass, and the S5's interface doesn't have the clean elegance of a Nexus 5 or Moto X. I'm still suspicious of S Voice, which has never worked as well as Google Now for me. But especially if that camera pans out, the Samsung S5 will be an amazing way to track your own life and the world around you.The Samsung Galaxy S5 will be available "globally" in April, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, MetroPCS, and U.S. Cellular in the U.S.Samsung�s Galaxy S5 is here with more power, more pixels, and a refined designThis year�s flagship doesn�t mess with a winning formulaWhat do you do when you�re one of the world�s largest smartphone makers and it�s time to update your flagship device? If you�re Samsung, you trot out the new Galaxy S5, a refined and updated take on last year�s wildly successful Galaxy S4. Like the new Gear wearables, the Galaxy S5 looks and feels familiar, but offers a number of improvements over last year�s edition.The Galaxy S5�s design is a minor evolution of the Galaxy S4 � in fact, the two are almost indistinguishable from the front. The S5�s display is ever so slightly larger at 5.1 inches, but it�s still a 1080p, Super AMOLED panel that doesn�t look very different from the S4�s screen. Below the display is a new home key with integrated fingerprint scanner and capacitive keys for multitasking and Android�s back button.Samsung has retained the familiar metal-looking plastic surround on the S5, though the charging port (now USB 3.0) comes with an integrated port cover for waterproofing. The S5 is IP67-rated for water and dust resistance, meaning it can be submerged in 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes at a time.Though the S5 is extremely familiar-looking from the front, things take a turn around back, where Samsung has replaced the S4�s slimy, glossy plastic battery cover with a dimpled soft-touch finish. The company is calling this a "modern glam" look, though if you�re familiar with the original Nexus 7 released in 2012, it�s very similar to that. The new back offers a significant upgrade in they way the device feels � it�s much more comfortable to hold and doesn�t slide off of surfaces nearly as much as the S4 � but it doesn�t look as tacky as the fake-leather patterns used on Samsung�s Note line of devices. Samsung is offering the S5 in four different colors � black, white, blue, and gold � but the black and white are the most attractive options. The first complaint usually levied at Samsung�s Galaxy smartphones is their abundant use of glossy, cheap feeling plastic, but the S5�s new finish reverses this trend and is one of the most significant upgrades introduced this year."A Familiar design, But with less glossy plastic"But despite the refined design and new patterned finish, the S5 is unmistakably a Samsung smartphone. The S5 is launching with Android 4.4.2 KitKat with Samsung�s user interface fully intact. Though earlier reports had said that Samsung intended to tone down its software due to pressure from Google, the S5 retains much of the signature pieces of the Galaxy line. There are S-branded apps in many places, including the S Voice personal assistant, and Samsung�s signature bloops and whistles are present every time you interact with the device. The My Magazine feature, Samsung�s Flipboard-like news reader that debuted on the Note 3, is accessible directly to the left of the home screen, but the main display is a very familiar assortment of folders, app shortcuts, and a weather widget. The most notable change is found in the settings menu, where Samsung has swapped out the tabbed interface for a single, vertical scrolling screen with round, flat icons.Galaxy S5 backSamsung is making a huge push into fitness tracking this year, and the Galaxy S5 benefits from a revamped S Health app and new heart-rate sensor on its back. The new S Health app can sync with Samsung�s Gear line of wearables, including the Gear Fit fitness band, and it offers guided coaching and feedback while you work out. Developers will be able to tap into the data offered by the service through an SDK that will be out later this year.The heart rate monitor is a unique addition and is located just below the camera and reads your fingertip to grab your pulse in about five to ten seconds. In our brief tests, the sensor worked as advertised and was able to give me a reading in just a few seconds."Heart-rate monitors and fingerprint scanners"Less successful is Samsung�s take on the fingerprint-unlock system made popular by Apple with the iPhone 5S. Like the 5S, the S5�s home key features an integrated fingerprint scanner, which can be used to unlock the phone or authenticate purchases online (Samsung is partnering with PayPal to enable this feature, though it doesn�t validate purchases from the Google Play Store). Samsung�s version requires a vertical swipe over the home button to activate the scanner, and we found it to be quite unreliable and virtually impossible to activate when holding the phone in one hand. It can store up to three different digits, but it was very particular about the speed and orientation of the swiping motion used � if we weren�t doing a perfectly straight swipe down, it would refuse to unlock the phone.Samsung didn�t ignore the other vital components of the S5 � it has a faster, 2.5GHz quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, a larger battery with the promised 20 percent better stamina, as well as a new low-power conservation mode to get the most battery possible when you�re running low. The S5 is as fast as you�d expect � Samsung has ensured that its flagship phone is one of the most powerful on the market for a number of years now, and the S5 is no different.Galaxys5_500_portraitThe camera has been upgraded to a 16-megapixel sensor with 4K video capabilities, and it now supports real-time HDR processing for better photos in mixed lighting. It�s now possible to apply Samsung�s unique camera effects after a picture has been taken, so you don�t have to worry about what mode you�re in when shooting pics. Samsung has also greatly simplified the camera interface, and in our brief tests, it was pretty snappy and responsive."The S5 builds on what worked with the S4"Samsung had a successful formula with the Galaxy S4, and for the most part, it looks like it has retained that with the S5. Things are faster, nicer feeling, and easier to use, but it�s still a Samsung smartphone through and through, and will likely be just as successful if not more so than its predecessor.The Galaxy S5 is scheduled to launch globally on April 11th and will be available on all major US carriers, though Samsung isn�t yet ready to talk pricing. Chances are, the price won�t matter � Samsung has built a very recognizable and successful brand with its Galaxy smartphones, and there�s no reason the S5 won�t continue the company�s success.Samsung Galaxy S5 camera reviewConnect smartphone reviews are written with the needs of photographers in mind. We focus on camera features, performance and image quality.The S5 is the latest model in Samsung's line of Galaxy S flagship smartphones and replaces last year's Galaxy S4. The new model's camera comes with a slightly larger 1/2.6-inch CMOS BSI sensor and an increased pixel-count of 16MP (up from the S4's 13MP) but the maximum aperture remains unchanged at F2.2. Like its phablet sibling the Galaxy Note III, the S5 offers 4K video capture but has to make do without an optical image stabilization system.Samsung also claims to have improved AF speeds by implementing a phase-detection system, similar to what's being used in digital SLRs. Other new imaging features include real-time HDR processing , a new camera user interface and the Selective Focus feature that allows you to blur the background by taking two pictures at different focus settings and merging them, similar to Background Defocus on the Sony Xperia Z2 or Nokia's Refocus app.In terms of design, with its rounded corners, metal band around the edges and the faux-leather back, the S5 looks like a cross between Galaxy S4 and Note III. However, the new model is also dust and water resistant with an IP67 rating, which means you can keep snapping in adverse weather conditions. As you would expect from a Galaxy S device the non-camera components are top-notch, too. Android 4.4.2 is powered by a Qualcomm quad-core 2.5 GHz Snapdragon S801 processor and 2GB of RAM. Images can be stored on 16 or 32GB of internal memory or microSD-card and the 1080p Super AMOLED screen measures a generous 5.1 inches. Read on to find out if and how all the high-end specifications translate into mobile photography performance.Key Photographic / Video Specifications1/2.6-inch 16MP BSI CMOS sensorF2.231mm focal length (35mm equivalent)4K video recording2MP front cameraSlow motion videoElectronic image stabilizationOther SpecificationsQualcomm Snapdragon S801 2.5GHz quad-core processor2GB RAM16/32GB internal memory, microSD slot up to 64GBAndroid 4.4.2 (Kitkat)5.1-inch Super AMOLED screen (1920 x 1080)Dust and water resistant (IP67)NFCPulse meter2800mAh BatteryOur 11-page reviewWe've considered every aspect of the Samsung Galaxy S5, with the photographer in mind. We examined the user interface of the native camera app and its special features. We experimented with the camera's performance when taking stills and video, and had a play with the device's many special feature modes. Click any of the links below for more information of specific functions and continue to our conclusion for a final summary of our findings.In terms of hardware the Samsung Galaxy S5 offers some of the best you can find in a 2014 flagship smartphone.  The device is powered by one of Qualcomm's currently most powerful SoCs, a 2.5 GHz Snapdragon S801 quad-core unit. The S5 offers 2GB of RAM and users can pick between versions with 16 or 32 GB of storage. If you need more space for your images there is a microSD card slot, too.The Android 4.4.2 OS is controlled via a 5.1-inch 1080p Super AMOLED touchscreen that offers very good viewing angles and brightness. Compared to the predecessor the screen has grown slightly but comes at the same 1080p resolution. A couple of recent high-end devices, the Oppo Find 7 and LG G3, haven overtaken their Samsung rival in this respect by offering qHD screens with the staggering resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. Also worth mentioning are the fingerprint sensor and microUSB 3.0 port.The Galaxy S5 does not disappoint in terms of camera hardware either. The 1/2.6-inch CMOS BSI sensor has not quite the same dimensions as the 1/2.3-inch sensors in most consumer level compact cameras or Sony's Xperia Z1 and Z2 but is larger than the tiny 1/3-inch sensors used in most smartphones including the S5's predecessors. At F2.2 the maximum aperture remains unchanged though and the new model still does not come with an optical image stabilization system. In terms of AF Samsung uses a new approach (at least among smartphone makers) by adding phase detection sensors to the usual contrast detect system.With its rounded corners, metal band around the edges and the faux-leather back, the S5 looks pretty much like a smaller version of the Galaxy Note III phablet and as such a little bland. The S5 does not have the minimalist look nor the premium feel of metal and glass dominated devices, such as the HTC One M8 or Sony's Xperia Z models but still gives you the impression of being a solid device. It's also water- and dust resistant with an IP67 rating, which allows you to take photos in the rain or on the beach without having to worry about your expensive device.Like most current high-end Android phones the S5 is quite large and if you have smaller hands probably too large for one-handed operation. Nevertheless when using the device as a camera and holding it with two hands it feels natural and thanks to their positioning there is very little danger of obscuring lens or flash with a finger.The S5 is one of the few Android phones that still offers a physical home button. We prefer the on-screen versions of the competition but this is arguably a matter of personal taste. Additionally you get the power button on the right and volume rockers on the left side of the device but no dedicated two-way shutter button.The Galaxy S5 does not have a physical shutter button to open the camera app, so you have to tap on the camera icon or you can activate a camera short-cut on the lock-screen via the settings menu. The latter is not quite as quick as the shutter-button solution on the Sony Xperia Z devices or the Nokia Lumias but still gives you easy access to the camera.The camera app opens swiftly and once inside things are pretty straightforward. You press the shutter button on the right to capture an image and tap on the screen to focus. If that's one step too many for you, 'tap to take pics' can be activated in the settings menu.Exposure is not linked to the focus point, so you cannot influence the brightness of an image by focusing on a specifically dark or bright area of the preview image. That wouldn't be much of a problem if the S5' exposure compensation option would not be buried deep in the menu. However, you have to enter the gear menu and then scroll down all the way to the bottom before you'll find the option. This process is more long winded than you'd wish but you can obtain better control over exposure on the Galaxy S5 by installing a third-party camera app, such as Camera FV-5 or Google's own Camera app.It seems the S5 camera app wants to offer anything you could possibly do with a smartphone camera in one single app. However, despite the large number shooting modes and options, the control structure is quite well thought-out and pretty intuitive. There is a column of four shortcuts on the left side of the screen and you can pull any of the option tiles in the settings menu to one of the shortcut slots to customize your UI. The default shortcuts are front/rear camera switch, selective focus, HDR mode and the menu.  You can also change the order of items within the settings menu. Here you've got access to ISO, video mode and digital image stabilization among other parameters.The Mode button below the virtual shutter button gives you access to the S5's special shooting modes that we'll talk more about on the features pages in this review. Overall Samsung's newly redesigned camera app offers a lot of features and functions and is well structured, but those who want exposure compensation or a simpler approach to smartphone picture taking might want to look for alternatives in the Google Play Store.FeaturesThe Galaxy S5's camera app comes with many features and functions that we've already seen on the Galaxy S4, so in this section we have focused on the most important and new ones. To make the S4's already very busy user interface not feel even more cluttered Samsung has decided to remove a few of the old modes, such as Animated Photo, Sports Shot and Sound & Shot, and make them available as optional downloads for those who really want or need them.Some modes, such as the new Selective Focus, can be found in the menu, others are accessible through the mode button. Read on to find out how they performed in our test.Rich Tone (HDR Mode)The Galaxy S5's HDR mode works in a similar way as on most other devices. The camera takes three frames at varying exposures in quick succession and combines them into one 'High Dynamic Range' image. The S5's 1/2.6-inch sensor is a little larger than the tiny 1/3-chips on most smartphones but its dynamic range is, compared to most dedicated cameras, still limited, so this feature can be a life saver when shooting high contrast scenes.Overall the S5's HDR mode is one of the best we've seen so far and there is a strong case to be made for leaving it on all the time. There are no parameters to play with but the S5 Rich Tone mode produces very natural results with additional highlight and shadow detail, adapting its intensity to the scene automatically. In the first sample below Rich Tone recovers some detail in the sky and lifts the shadows just a touch, without giving the scene an artificial look.In the sample below the impact on highlight detail is only minor but the dark shadows inside the abandoned building are lifted moderately to reveal additional shadow detail. Shadow noise is well-controlled and the end results still look natural.When looking at the full-size image you can see that there is no ghosting on the cyclist in the scene and generally subjects that are moving at moderate speed are dealt with very well. We hardly came across any ghosting or blurring in the many HDR images we shot for this review.The intensity of the effect appears to be adapted automatically depending on the scene. In the sample image below the strong back light caused the camera to meter for the sky and underexpose the lawn and building in the lower half of the frame. Rich Tone detects this underexposure and lifts the shadows quite extremely. Nevertheless the end results is more than usable, with decent detail and noise levels.PanoramaThe panorama app seems to be working in a very similar way to the Galaxy S4's and the results are equally impressive. Image size varies between shots but landscape panos tend to be around 20,000 pixels wide and around 3000 pixels tall. Vertical panoramas aren't as wide but, as you'd expect, a little taller. In any case they offer more image detail than most other panorama modes we have seen.Stitching and exposure are typically fine too, but occasionally you'll find some ghosting on moving subjects, or, like in the first sample below, a subject that appears twice in the scene. That said, overall the S5's panorama mode is dealing well with motion in the scene and its image output is suitable for large format printing. You can shoot both in landscape or portrait orientation and if you don't want or need to capture a full 360-degree panorama, you can press the shutter button any time to stop. The app will then create a panorama with the images you have recorded up to that point.Dual Shot and front cameraThe Galaxy S4 was the first smartphone capable of recording images from its front- and rear cameras simultaneously and of course its successor comes with the same feature. Dual Shot mode allows you to capture images with both cameras at the same time and create a picture-in-picture effect with a variety of frames to surround your front-facing camera capture.Like on the S4 the default is a stamp frame that creates a postcard effect when combined with a scenic vista. The size of the inserted image and frame is adjustable, in the sample below we are showing the maximum dimension.The front camera offers a fairly standard 1080p Full-HD resolution which is in line with most of the competition but cannot keep up with the 5MP and 8MP equivalents in the HTC One M8 and Huawei Ascend P7 respectively. As you would expect the image quality is far inferior to the rear camera module, with a lot of detail blurring through noise reduction and noise in low light, but it's good enough for the occasional selfie or Dual Shot image in decent light.Night ModeThe Galaxy S5's Night Mode avoids intrusive noise by blending a quick burst of frames into one image and averaging out the noise. The mode works in a very similar way to what we've seen on previous models but it appears this latest version has slightly improved at dealing with moving subjects. The latter can still create artifacts but at least on slow moving subjects, such as walking persons, ghosting is hardly noticeable. Nevertheless it is still recommendable to avoid any camera shake while capturing the burst.While on the S4 with its maximum ISO of 1000 one of the mode's main advantages was the ability to still achieve a decent exposure in very low light, on the Galaxy S5 with its higher maximum ISO of 2000 this is less of an issue. You still get the benefit of cleaner images though, just keep in mind that you pay for the cleanliness with a total lack of fine detail and a slight image softness, as can be seen in the crops below.Features cont.Selective FocusIt appears on the current generation of smartphone cameras some kind of fake narrow-depth-of-field effect is a must-have feature. Nokia started it all with the Refocus app, Sony's Xperia Z2 has Selective Focus and HTC even opted for a hardware solution with the Duo Cam. However, even if you have an older or lower-spec phone you don't have to live without this kind of effect as it is now also available in the latest version of the Google Camera App that can be downloaded free of charge on the Google Play Store and runs on most devices.So far none of those variations of the same thing, even the HTC hardware solution, have been able to convince us. Rather than creating a smooth fall-off in sharpness they introduce a very abrupt transition and the foreground/background separation tends to lack precision, giving the images an artificial look. Sadly the Samsung version, also called Selective Focus, is no different . The mode takes a series of images at different focus settings and then lets you choose a focus point after capture and save your preferred image. According to instructions you should not be any farther from the subject than 1.5 feet and the background should be at least three times that distance from the subject.In reality the mode simply doesn't work most of the time, even if you stick to the recommended subject/background distances. I tried the feature with living subjects and static scenes but almost always my efforts were followed by a 'Subject not detected' message which means the effect could not be applied.The sample above is one of the few that actually let me choose the focus point. As you can see I was able to set the focus on the Nowitzki action figure in the foreground and the garden scenery in the background. However, the image would not let me select the Pan Focus option. All in all most users won't be too bothered by the limited functionality of the mode but given it is there, Samsung should make sure it improves its operation with a software update at some point.Virtual TourVirtual Tour is another new feature and lets you create an interactive virtual tour by combining several still shots using pans, zooms and fades to create smooth transitions. The app also guides you in terms of framing of those shots. The end result can be viewed in an interactive Google Streetview-like fashion in the gallery or can be saved as a video.You'll have to have a specific use case for this feature but it's a good way of virtually showing you around a home, office or other space. Below you can enjoy a video that was taken at my parent's house, showing the route from the terrace into my first floor temporary office space.As you can see the transitions and stitching are far from perfect but in certain circumstances that don't require professional grade quality the feature could be useful and preferable to a standard video.Filter effectsThere is a plethora of filter apps available on the Google Play Store but for those who want the feature out of the box Samsung includes a range of effects in the default camera app. There are twelve filters in total and most of the effects we've seen before on previous Samsung devices. The list of filters can be customized, so you don't always have to scroll through the entire list if you only tend to use a few of the available effects.The filters are all pretty standard fare and don't offer any control over the strength of the effect. They have the advantage of live preview and are fun to play with but most users will likely find third-party editing apps, such as Pixlr Express or Snapseed, that give you more control, more useful. Then of course there is also Instagram and its various clones.Shot & MoreThe Shot & More mode combines the Best Photo, Best Face, Drama Shot and Eraser features we already know from the Galaxy S4 and adds Panning Shot to the mix, to make for a less cluttered user interface. In Shot & More mode the camera takes a burst of shots and then offers a variety of options, depending on the moving subjects that have been captured during the burst.Best Shot suggests the best image from your burst but also allows you to pick your favorite manually. Best Face does the same for images with human subjects, putting a focus on open eyes and smiles. Drama shot allows you to create an action composite image and Eraser to delete unwanted objects that moved through the scene while you were capturing the burst. Finally, Panning Shot identifies moving subjects and allows you to apply a blur effect to the rest of the image, giving it a fake panning effect.Overall the Shot & More features have a rather gimmicky character and the results are never quite predictable. They are fun to play and experiment with for a while but most mobile photographers won't use them on an ongoing basis.Gallery AppThe Samsung Galaxy S5's Gallery App is more comprehensive than most default Gallery apps. It comes with a good selection of editing options, including selection tools for selective editing of image areas. There are a few new filter options, including some light streak effects, but overall the app is similar to what we've seen on previous Samsung devices.The app offers all the standard editing options such as rotation, cropping and a range of color and tonal modifications, but you also get a number of filter effects, frames and the option to draw on the images or put "stickers" on them. You can also share images to social networks, other devices or other apps.Overall the gallery app offers a lot to play with and is well worth a closer look if you haven't found your favorite editing app in the Google Play Store yet.Image Quality and PerformanceWith its cutting edge hardware and latest Android version the Galaxy S5's performance is impressive all around. Apps open up quickly, scrolling and swiping is very smooth and processing tasks, for example in editing apps, take very little time. In our test only the gallery app seemed a bit sluggish at times but Samsung has fixed that with a firmware update, so make sure you have the latest software version running if your gallery seems a little slow.With Burst Shot activated in the settings the camera captures 30 shots in approximately two seconds. While this is quite an impressive number, as usual you don't have any control over shutter speed, so in low light you will inevitably end up with motion blur due to a slow shutter. This makes the mode pretty much unsuitable for the capture of indoor action.The performance of the new phase detect AF system is reasonably fast in good light but not noticeably quicker than the competition with more conventional systems. However, in low light the S5 AF is one of the best, with fast and reliable performance even in very dim conditions. We found very few focus errors in our hundreds of samples shot while working on this review.It's also worth mentioning that the S5's battery performance is quite impressive, taking us easily through the day, even with heavy use. However, not only does the battery last long, it also charges quicker than most other devices we have used. So even if you do run out of juice on the Samsung, it'll take little time with the charger plugged in for you to get going again.With its 16MP 1/2.6-inch BSI CMOS sensor the Galaxy S5 offers one of the most intriguing camera specs among current smartphones. Read on to find out how the high pixel count and slightly larger than usual sensor translate into real-life image quality.Daylight, Low ISOIn good light the Samsung Galaxy S5 produces some of the best image output we have seen from a smartphone. Despite some blurring of fine low-contrast detail the S5 captures excellent detail with just the right amount of sharpening. At a 100% view the images look crisp without being oversharpened.Some grain can be seen in shadow areas or areas of plain color but it's all within well acceptable smartphone levels and at low ISOs noise reduction is less intrusive than on most other mobile devices. The high pixel count makes the Samsung's images more vulnerable to lens imperfections though and you'll find some softness towards the edges of the frame.The images are free of artifacts, chromatic aberrations are well-controlled by the JPEG-engine and we could not find any moir� patterns in our samples. Colors tend to be a touch saturated and images are usually well exposed, although the HDR mode can be a useful tool in high-contrast scenes.The samples below show how much detail is captured by the Galaxy S5 camera. There is some smearing of detail in the distant foliage but overall the levels of detail are excellent for a smartphone. In the right image you can see some of the edge softness mentioned above.Both images below show again good detail but on the left the S5's relatively strong saturation leads to an unnaturally warm rendering of skin tone. In the right image you can see that in bright and contrasty conditions the Samsung is, like most smartphone, prone to highlight clipping.These are two more samples to demonstrate the level of detail captured by the S5 camera. For flower shots, like the image on the right, captured in Macro mode, the high saturation works better than for portraits.Low Light, High ISOIn lower light the Samsung Galaxy S5 again performs well. Good color is maintained across the ISO range and well-balanced noise reduction means that, while grain is visible at all sensitivities, it never becomes too intrusive or turns into ugly looking "noise-blotches". Traces of chroma noise are visible at large magnifications from early on but overall color noise is again well-controlled across the ISO range. The S5's high megapixel count also means that when images are down-sampled for web use or social sharing noise is averaged out, making even the ISO 2000 exposures usable for those purposes.Like on most smartphones the S5 uses very slow shutter speeds in low light to keep the ISO down. Without an optical image stabilization system this often leads to a slight softness through camera shake. If you need a 100% sharp low light shot it is therefore always recommendable to shoot a batch of images to increase your chances of having at least one good one.For the indoor portrait below the S5 only has to raise the ISO to 200 but increased noise levels are noticeable in the shadow areas if you view at 100%. Overall the image is still pretty clean though. The bigger problem is the slight overall softness caused by camera shake and the relatively slow shutter speed. In situations like this we would prefer the camera to opt for a slightly higher ISO and accept a touch more noise in return for a shake-free image. The ISO 320 image on the right shows some loss of detail at 100% but looks clean with pleasant colors when viewed at only slightly smaller sizes.Shadow noise and blurring of detail through noise reduction becomes more obvious as the ISO increases but again you have to zoom pretty far into the images below before those imperfections become too intrusive. The camera used a shutter speed of 1/17 sec for both images which poses a high risk of camera shake. Both pictures are the sharpest out of a series including various slightly blurry exposures.Compared to the output of many other smartphones the Galaxy S5's output still looks decent at the highest ISOs. There is a lot of grain but still some fine detail left. Edge sharpness is still good and chroma noise well under control. Color is maintained very well.For the image on the left the camera selected an unusually high shutter speed of 1/100 sec which freezes the motion of the moving subjects but also pushes the ISO to 1250. Nevertheless the image is still more than usable on the web or in social media. The same is true for the right image for the capture of which the S5 pushed ISO to its highest setting, ISO 2000.FlashTiny LED flash units mean that flash use on smartphone cameras is generally best avoided. Low output power often leads to noisy images and blurry subjects. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is no exception but still performs at least slightly better than many competing devices.Its LED flash provides enough power to keep the ISO relatively low, even in very low light, and by doing so can reduce image noise and maintain more detail than many competitors. As you can see in the samples below skin tones are rendered a little warm but that's arguably preferable to the cool color casts you'll get from some other devices. Red-eye effect is very well controlled as well.As with most smartphones the only control over flash exposure you have is to switch it on, off or into Auto mode. The shutter speed of 1/30 sec is not going to freeze any fast motion but should help you get reasonably sharp images in most circumstances.SummaryThe Galaxy S5 is Samsung's latest flagship smartphone and successor to the Galaxy S4. It comes with a 16MP BSI CMOS sensor, an F2.2 maximum aperture, 4K video capture and phase detection AF, but has to make do without an optical image stabilization system.Android 4.4 is powered by the latest generation Qualcomm quad-core 2.5 GHz Snapdragon S801 processor and 2GB of RAM. The Super AMOLED screen measures 5.1 inches and comes with the same 1080p resolution as the S4. You can choose between 16GB or 32GB versions and storage can be expanded via a microSD slot.With a DxOMark Mobile score of 79 the Samsung Galaxy S5 shares the number one spot in the DxOMark smartphone rankings with the Sony Xperia Z2, placing itself in front of the Nokia 808 and the Sony Xperia Z1.The DxOMark team reports that the Galaxy S5 images show 'good auto-exposure, pleasant, rich and realistic colors, good white balance, low noise levels in low light conditions and good sharpness and details in the center of the frame.' The testers found 'almost no color fringing or ringing' and liked the 'good image quality with flash.'On the downside there is 'a noticeable loss of detail in low light conditions and non-uniform sharpness across the image field.' The team also found the AF not to be always accurate in Auto Mode.In video mode the Galaxy S5 produces the 'best mobile video tested to date', with 'good autofocus and good textures.' On the downside there are 'visible color non-uniformities in some light conditions.'Still PhotographyColor, Exposure and ContrastThe DxOMark team found that the Samsung Galaxy S5 images show 'good auto-exposure even in difficult outdoor situations, pleasant, rich and realistic colors in all light conditions and overall good white balance.'However, the testers also found that 'in high dynamic range scenes, images can be slightly burnt out' and 'with some indoor tungsten lighting a slight color shading can be noticed.'Overall DxOMark awarded the Samsung Galaxy S5 scores of:4.5 out of 5 for Exposure4.5 out of 5 for White Balance accuracy4.0 out of 5 for Color shading in low light*4.0 out of 5 for Color shading in bright light*3.0 out of 5 for Color Rendering in low light4.5 out of 5 for Color Rendering in bright light*Color Shading is the nasty habit cellphone cameras have of rendering different areas of the frame with different color shifts, resulting in pictures with, for example, pinkish centers and greenish corners.Noise and DetailsDxOMark's engineers reported the that when shooting with the Galaxy S5 'a lot of detail is visible across the frame' with 'low noise levels in low light conditions'. The testers found the S5's noise and detail levels to be 'better than the Galaxy S4'. On the downside there is a 'noticeable loss of details in low light conditions.'Texture AcutanceTexture acutance is a way of measuring the ability of a camera to capture images that preserve fine details, particularly the kind of low contrast detail that can be blurred away by noise reduction or obliterated by excessive sharpening (such as fine foliage, hair or fur).Sharpness is an important part of the quality of an image, but while it's easy to look at an image and decide visually whether it's sharp or not, the objective measurement of sharpness is less straightforward.An image can be defined as 'sharp' if edges are sharp and if fine details are visible. In-camera processing means that it's possible to have one of these (sharp edges) but not the other (fine details). Conventional MTF measurements tell us how sharp an edge is, but have drawbacks when it comes to measuring fine detail preservation. Image processing algorithms can detect edges and enhance their sharpness, but they can also find homogeneous areas and smooth them out to reduce noise.Texture acutance, on the other hand, can qualify sharpness in terms of preservation of fine details, without being fooled by edge enhancement algorithms.A dead leaf pattern is designed to measure texture acutance. It's obtained by drawing random shapes that occlude each other in the plane, like dead leaves falling from a tree. The statistics of this model follow the distribution statistics in natural images.In this example from a DSLR without edge enhancement, sharpness seems equal on edge and on texture. Many details are visible in the texture.In this second example, edges have been digitally enhanced, and the edge looks over sharp, with visible processing halos ('ringing'). On the texture part, many details have disappeared.At first sight, the images from these two cameras may appear equally sharp. A sharpness measurement on edges will indeed confirm this impression, and will even show that the second camera is sharper. But a closer examination of low contrasted textures shows that the first camera has better preservation of fine details than the second. The purpose of the texture acutance measurement is to qualify this difference.Note: Acutance is a single value metric calculated from a MTF result. Acutance is used to assess the sharpness of an image as viewed by the human visual system, and is dependent on the viewing conditions (size of image, size of screen or print, viewing distance). Only the values of texture acutance are given here. The measurements are expressed as a percentage of the theoretical maximum for the chosen viewing condition. The higher the score, the more details can be seen in an image.For all DxOMark Mobile data presented on connect.dpreview.com we're only showing 8MP equivalent values, which gives us a level playing field for comparison between smartphone cameras with different megapixel values by normalizing all to 8MP (suitable for fairly large prints). DxOMark also offers this data for lower resolution use-cases (web and onscreen). For more information on DxOMark's testing methodology and acutance measurements please visit the website at www.dxomark.com.FlashDxOMark scored the Samsung Galaxy S5 82/100 overall for its flash performance which is three points less than the Sony Xperia Z2.Pros:Good detail preservation, accurate white balance and colorCons:Some white balance errors in mixed lightNo red eye correctionOverall DxOMark Mobile Score for Photo: 79 / 100Video CaptureDxOMark engineers put phone cameras through a similarly grueling set of video tests, and you can read their full findings on the DxOMark website here. Bottom line: DxOMark found the Samsung Galaxy S5's overall video performance to be the best of all devices tested so far, with nice textures and good AF. Only in some light conditions the Samsung can struggle with color reproduction.Pros:Best mobile video tested to dateWell balanced video mode, without any major flawsGood autofocusGood textureCons:Visible color non-uniformities in some light conditionsIn our brightly lit studio scene the Samsung Galaxy S5 can take advantage of its 16MP sensor and resolves more detail than most of the competition. This is true for high-contrast detail as it can be found in the resolution charts in our test scene as well as low-contrast in the feathers and fabrics.Well-balanced sharpening means that edges look crisp without any halos or other sharpening artifacts and low levels of noise reduction at base ISO ensure less blurring of fine detail than the competition and pleasant rendering of low-contrast areas in the frame. The image is also pretty clean, with very little noise in areas of plain color and no artifacts, but a touch of lens softness is noticeable towards the edges of the frame.In our low light studio tests the Samsung Galaxy S5 opts for a relatively high ISO 1250 to achieve a slightly brighter exposure than some of the competition but thanks to a well-balanced approach to noise reduction edge detail is still very well maintained. At such high sensitivities fine low-contrast detail suffers noticeably but but can still more than keep up with the competition.There is visible grain in the image but it's not blurred into unsightly 'blotches' by noise reduction and overall the S5 output looks cleaner and more artifact-free than most of the competition's low-light samples. Color is also maintained well and chroma noise is very well controlled. Downsizing the Samsung images for web-use and social sharing will average noise out further and make even images shot at the highest sensitivities usable.ConclusionConclusion - The GoodExcellent image detail in bright lightGood balance between detail and noise reduction across ISO rangeNo chromatic aberrations, purple fringing, moir� or other artifactsGood color maintained up to the highest ISO settingsDecent flash performanceGood video quality, 4k, HDR and slow motion modesResponsive performanceComprehensive camera feature setGood HDR modePanorama mode produces very large and detailed imagesComprehensive editing options in gallery appPartly customizable camera UImicroSD slot offers expandable storage for images and videoRemovable battery with fast chargingWater- and dust-resistant body (IP67)Conclusion - The BadSome image softness towards the edges of the frameExposure compensation buried in menuNo optical image stabilization and slow shutter speeds mean danger of camera shake in low lightFairly strong saturation can lead to unnatural skin tones in portraitsSelective Focus feature pretty much unusableOverall ConclusionOpinions might be split about the Galaxy S5's design and choice of body materials but looking at the pros and cons list above it's clear that Samsung's latest flagship smartphone has a lot to offer to mobile photographers.The camera's 1/2.6-inch BSI CMOS sensor captures excellent image quality with very good detail in bright light and well-balanced noise reduction across the ISO range. The only major points of criticism are a total lack of control over exposure in the default camera app and the the slow shutter speeds in low light which, without optical image stabilization, can result in slightly soft images. That said, at least the former issue can be solved easily by installing a third party alternative.Feature lovers will appreciate both the camera and gallery apps which are packed with shooting modes and editing functions. Many of them are of a rather gimmicky nature but the arguably most used ones, such as HDR and panorama mode, deliver excellent results.Movie mode offers good image quality and features, too. Throw excellent battery life, fast charging and a water- and dust proof body into the mix and you got yourself a device that most mobile photographers will have a lot of fun with.Features & OperationThe Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with high-end hardware all around and is therefore very responsive in general operation and performs most tasks swiftly without delays. Initially the gallery app felt a little sluggish but Samsung has fixed this with a software update, so if picture browsing and editing is a little slower than it should be on your S5 make sure you have the latest software installed.The camera app offers one of the most comprehensive feature sets with an abundance of modes and functions that'll take you a good while to explore. If that's still not enough you can download and install more shooting modes from the Samsung App Store. Some of the features have a slightly gimmicky character or, like the new Selective Focus, simply don't work very well but the two special modes that arguably matter most to many users, HDR and Panorama mode, work very efficiently and produce great results.The sheer number of options can make the camera app appear a little overwhelming and one by many users frequently used option, exposure compensation is buried in the menu and difficult to get to. You cannot link exposure to the focus point either. So, to capture that low- or high-key image with ease or simply have some more creative freedom you'll have to install a third-party camera app like FV-5 or Google's own camera app.Image QualityIn good light the Samsung Galaxy S5 camera captures some of the best detail we have seen on a mobile device. As usual on smartphone cameras there are traces of noise in areas of plain color and some blurring of fine low-contrast detail but overall the Samsung's image output is excellent, with good exposure, well-balanced sharpening and no artifacts, such as moir� patterns or chromatic aberrations. The only minor points of criticism are a touch of lens softness towards the edges of the frame and a pretty strong saturation that can result in slightly unnatural skin tones.In lower light the Samsung Galaxy S5 again performs well but the lack of an optical image stabilization and slow shutter speeds mean that some low light image suffer from a slight softness due to camera shake. If you need a 100% sharp low light shot it is therefore recommendable to shoot a batch of images to make sure you have at least one good one.Other than that low light images show good color across the ISO range. Traces of chroma noise are visible at large magnifications but overall color noise is very well under control. The grainy kind of noise increases as you go up the ISO scale but never becomes too intrusive and even images taken at the highest sensitivity, ISO 2000, are suitable for web use and sharing in social media. The Galaxy S5 high pixel count means that when images are downsampled for web use or social sharing noise is averaged out.The Final WordThe Samsung Galaxy S5 combines a very comprehensive imaging feature set with the best image quality we have seen on an Android device so far. The camera on Samsung's flagship smartphone could be further improved with an optical image stabilization system but even without OIS the S5 is an easy recommendation to any mobile photographer using Google's mobile OS.Samsung Galaxy S5 (octa-core)Also known as Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900HNetwork 	TechnologyGSM / HSPALaunch 	Announced 	2014, MarchStatus 	Available.

These new products will be demonstrated in Samsung�s booth, Hall 2, Booth 2G40 at the Mobile World Congress, Fira Gran Via, Barcelona, Spain, February 24-27.Samsung�s new Exynos 5422, an advanced Exynos 5 Octa product for premium mobile devices, is designed to support the ever-increasing needs of high-resolution displays and complicated computation without sacrificing battery life. This new processor is equipped with eight cores�four big cores (ARM� Cortex�- A15� up to 2.1 GHz) for heavy loads and four small cores (ARM� Cortex�- A7� up to 1.5 GHz) for lighter jobs�that deliver up to 34 percent higher performance than in previous Exynos Octa models. Due to Samsung�s further optimized big.LITTLE� HMP (Heterogeneous Multi Processing) technology, any combination of up to eight cores is engineered to provide optimum performance for any given task.To support high-resolution displays requiring a higher rate of data calculation and bandwidth, such as WQHD (2560 x 1440) and WQXGA (2560 x 1600), Samsung has adopted new solutions with proprietary mobile image compression (MIC) and adaptive hibernation technology. With MIC, display data is compressed into half to minimize memory bandwidth requirement and uses only four MIPI lanes.To further reduce power requirements, an adaptive hibernation algorithm detects non-moving parts of dynamic images and freezes the data transfer. Both technologies are implemented in conjunction with Samsung�s mobile display driver IC (S6E3HA0 for WQHD and S6E3FA2 for FHD respectively), and save power consumption by up to 10 percent compared with conventional technologies.Samsung�s new Exynos 5422 also delivers an outstanding multimedia experience through advanced Multi Format Codec (MFC) that supports 4K UHD resolution. These multimedia enhancements enable users to enjoy life-like multimedia experience by creating and uploading richer mobile contents with greater ease.Exynos 5422 is developed using Samsung�s advanced 28 nanometer (nm) fabrication process node and supports HMP feature, saving overall power consumption by up to 10 percent with improved performance compared to mobile application processors fabricated with the 32nm process. Samples of the processor are available now and scheduled for mass production in the first quarter of 2014.Another addition to the Exynos portfolio, Exynos 5 Hexa (Exynos 5260) is designed to bring optimal performance and power efficiency required in the increasing mid- to high-end mobile market. The new Exynos 5 Hexa processor is powered by six CPU cores; two 1.7GHz ARM� Cortex�-A15 cores and four 1.3GHz ARM� Cortex�-A7 cores. Along with Exynos 5 Octa products, it adopts big.LITTLE HMP to provide the right mixture of cores for various tasks, resulting in up to 42 percent improved performance when compared with the previous Exynos 5 Dual products.Equipped with an embedded Display Port (eDP) interface and memory bandwidth supporting up to 12.8GB/s, the Exynos 5260 also supports WQXGA (2560 x 1600) display resolution. For excellent video experience, it is integrated with a video codec that enables Full HD (1080p) playback at up to 60 frames-per-second (fps) with encoding and decoding of various standards, such as H.264, MPEG4 and VP8. Exynos 5260 is currently in mass production.16Mp and 13Mp ISOCELL CMOS Image Sensors for High-Quality Viewing ExperienceSamsung�s new CMOS image sensor technology, ISOCELL, substantially increases light sensitivity and effectively controls the collection of electrons, resulting in higher color fidelity even in poor lighting conditions. By incorporating ISOCELL, the image sensor will have 30 percent decrease in crosstalk; 30 percent increase in full well capacity; and 20 percent wider chief ray angle. Using the new technology with 1.12�m ISOCELL pixels, Samsung is introducing two new CMOS image sensors �16 and 13Mpixel.The 16Mpixel ISOCELL imager provides a wider, clearer viewing experience to mobile device users by implementing a 16:9 aspect ratio, allowing for full-size, high-resolution images and video to be displayed on screen without field-of-view (FOV) loss. This high-speed sensor captures full FOV 16:9 full HD (1080p) video at 60fps, and for the first time in the industry, enables continuous shooting of all 16Mpixels at 30fps. Samples of the 16Mpixel ISOCELL CIS are available now and scheduled for mass production in the first quarter of 2014.Samsung�s new 13Mpixel ISOCELL CIS features Smart Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) technology, which allows users to capture images at 30fps. With a mosaic pattern of multiple exposures, images are then processed with an advanced algorithm for wider dynamic range. This enables users to capture details clearly in both bright and dark areas even in high contrast lighting conditions. This Smart WDR feature is based on Samsung�s advanced 65nm stacked process, where the pixel array is attached right on top of the logic circuit. Samsung�s 13Mpixel product is sampling now and is scheduled for mass production in the second quarter of 2014.3rd Generation NFC Chip Solution for Expanding Mobile Payment EcosystemSamsung introduces its 3rd generation near field communications (NFC) chip solution. This is the industry�s first NFC IC using 45nm embedded flash process, which enables easy and secure firmware updates as well as low power consumption.This new NFC solution offers handset designers more flexibility by adopting the industry�s smallest antenna with enhanced radio frequency performance. This was made possible by Samsung�s proprietary Smart Antenna technology, which optimizes impedances of both receiving and emitting parts respectively to improve sensitivity and power efficiency. The NFC chip solution is currently being sampled to customers and is scheduled for mass production in the second quarter of 2014.Wi-Fi Solution with Low Power Consumption for IoT ApplicationsSamsung offers its first wireless connectivity solution, S5N2120, for the growing Internet of Things (IoT) market. This solution supports IEEE 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz, and has an extremely small footprint, which is essential for a wide array of applications.This solution features an integrated micro control unit (MCU) with a power amplifier, power management, audio codec and direct microphone functions. With this MCU, OEM customers can easily reconfigure their existing designs to add Wi-Fi connectivity functions. This allows for a shorter development lead-time and less engineering resources are required.This flexibility along with excellent performance and a small footprint is optimal for battery-constrained applications such as Wi-Fi speakers, headsets, remote controls, digital & sports cameras, smart heating/cooling meters, sensors and other types of IoT or M2M applications. Samsung�s new Wi-Fi connectivity solution, S5N2120, is currently sampling and scheduled for mass production in the second quarter of 2014.*All functionality features, specifications, and other product information provided in this document including, but not limited to, the benefits, design, pricing, components, performance, availability, and capabilities of the product are subject to change without notice or obligation.Samsung quietly reveals a Galaxy S5 variant with an eight-core processorSo that's Samsung's new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5. The company makes the majority of the components itself, but what happened to those home-grown Exynos processors? Well, Samsung tells us that the GS5 will come in two variants, one with the 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 chip (the model that we tested out at MWC), and another with a 2.1GHz octo-core Exynos 5 processor. Samsung did the same with the Galaxy S4 last year, but we didn't pick up any huge differences in performance when we compared the two phones. The LTE-capable GS4s never left Korea, however, so we'd predict a similarly limited roll-out for any Exynos-powered GS5s.Samsung Announces Galaxy S5: Initial ThoughtsEvery year Samsung launches a new Galaxy S flagship smartphone, and as always, Samsung puts the best platform that can be bought in their devices. The Galaxy S5 is no exception, as the MSM8974AC, or Snapdragon 801, powers the Galaxy S5. The 8974AC is the 2.45 GHz bin of the MSM8974AB, a slightly massaged MSM8974 that first launched with the LG G2 and other devices in the summer of 2013. As a recap, the MSM8974AB increases the clock speed of the Hexagon DSP to 465 MHz from 320 MHz, and the LPDDR3 RAM clocks go from 800 MHz to 933 MHz. What really matters though, is that GPU goes from 450 MHz to 578 MHz from 8974 to 8974AC. I definitely have to point to Anand's piece on the Snapdragon 801 for anyone that wants to know moreThe other portion of the hardware story is the camera, which is probably one of the biggest areas for OEMs to distinguish themselves from the pack. Samsung seems to be playing it safe this year with a straight upgrade from 13MP to 16MP by increasing sensor size, and pixel size remains at 1.12 micron side edge length. It is notable that the camera sensor seems to be in a 16:9 aspect ratio, which would make it possible for both photos and videos to keep the same interface without odd reframing effects when going from photo preview to camcorder functionality. Optics are effectively unchanged from the Galaxy S5, as the focal length in 35mm equivalent remains at 31mm, the aperture remains at F/2.2. The one area where there could be a notable improvement is the promised ISOCELL technology, which physically separates pixels better to reduce quantum effects that can lead to lower image resolution and also increases dynamic range, although this will require testing to verify the claims made by Samsung. Samsung has also added 4K video recording for this phone and real time HDR to extend the dynamic range of the camera.The Galaxy S5 has 2GB of RAM, also not too surprising given the 32-bit ARMv7 architecture of the 8974AC.The display is a 1080p 5.1� panel, which makes this phone around the same size as the LG G2. Samsung has definitely improved AMOLED, but first impressions are unlikely to tell much when it comes to the quality of calibration and other characteristics of the device. In all likelihood, this will continue to use an RGBG pixel layout in order to improve aging characteristics as the various subpixels age at differing rates. I would expect max brightness to increase, although this may only show in very specific conditions such as extended sunlight exposure and low APL scenarios.The industrial design seems to be an evolution of the Note 3, with a texture that looks similar to that of the Nexus 7 2012. However, whether the stippled texture will actually avoid the long-term issue of a slimy/oily feel is another question that will have to be answered after the hands-on. While we're still on the point of the hardware design, the Galaxy S5 is IP67 rated, which is why the microUSB 3.0 port has a cover for water and dust resistance.The fingerprint sensor is a swipe-based one, and Brian has voiced displeasure over swipe sensors like those found in the One max. I personally think that there could be some issues with ergonomics, as Samsung places the home button very close to the edge of the phone, which would make it rather difficult to swipe correctly over the home button, especially if the device is being used with one hand.As always, Samsung has included removable battery and a microSD slot for those that need such capabilities, although now that Samsung is following Google guidelines regarding read/write permissions, the utility of the microSD slot could be much less than previously expected. For the battery, things are noticeably different as Samsung has gone with a 3.85V chemistry compared to the 3.8V chemistry previously used by the Galaxy S4. With a battery capacity of 10.78 WHr, this means that it has 2800 mAh. For reference, the Galaxy S4 had a 9.88 WHr battery with 2600 mAh.As always, Samsung has put TouchWiz on top of their build of Android that will ship with the Galaxy S5, and it mostly looks the same. There are definitely some new features though like My Magazine, which seems to be a way of presenting multiple sources of information using a scrollable list of tiles with images on them.There might be a trend here in the paragraphs, and while some may see it as a tic, it�s probably more representative of the consistency that Samsung is bringing to the table. �As always� means that people know what to expect, and while it may not be nearly as exciting to the tech press, average people live and die by what�s relatively familiar, not what�s new and exciting. The addition of new features and consistent improvements to performance without compromise relative to the previous generation is definitely something to be applauded, and with review units, hopefully it will be possible to see how the GS5 stacks up against the competition.At any rate, the phone will launch with blue, black, white, and gold colors. It launches April 11 in 150 countries.Samsung's Galaxy S5 has an 'ultra power saving' mode to maximize battery lifeSamsung's new Galaxy S5 doesn't skimp on battery power, with an expected 10 hours of web browsing and 12 hours of video playback on a single charge. When you're on hour 11 of watching cat videos with no charger in site, the handsets new "ultra power-saving mode" will keep your handset purring along by making the screen black-and-white and turning off all the non-essential services on your phone. Even better, Samsung says if you put your phone in standby mode with only 10 percent of the battery left, it will still last "up to 24 hours" before running out of juice.Samsung Galaxy S 5 ReviewPlatform PowerThe Galaxy S 5 includes Samsung's hallmark removable back cover and battery. The GS5 uses a 10.78Wh (2800mAh @ 3.85V) battery. The modest increase in battery capacity over the Galaxy S 4 is only a small part of the story. With the GS5, Samsung significantly improved the overall platform power story compared to the Galaxy S 4 (even more so than HTC's M7/M8 transition).The move to a Snapdragon 801 SoC brings with it all of the performance and power efficiency benefits of the design and its updated 28nm HPm manufacturing process. The connectivity side sees a big improvement in power efficiency thanks to the use of Qualcomm's QFE1100 envelope tracker. Samsung also significantly reduced display power consumption on the GS5 compared to the GS4, which is likely the result of higher quantum efficiency (more brightness for less power), and panel self refresh. The result is a device that's bigger, faster and at the same time, far more power efficient than its predecessor. To me the biggest benefit of having a removable back cover and removable battery is the ability to quickly instrument the device to measure power consumption. I did just that with the Galaxy S 5 (T-Mobile) and GS4 (AT&T) to help characterize the improvement in total device power. All of the numbers below are taken with both displays calibrated to 200 nits.The GS4's display in particular was horribly inefficient, particularly at higher brightness values. The GS5 addresses that problem and appears to shoot for a sub-3W operating envelope in most situations. It is absolutely possible to get the device to draw more power than that however. Running a Speedtest while connected to T-Mobile's LTE network (with the display at minimum brightness), I measured an average power draw of 4.38W. With the display running at full brightness I measured 5.18W platform power draw while capturing 1080p video, and a whopping 6.54W while capturing 4K video. Assuming no thermal throttling, you could run through the GS5's battery in 1.64 hours by simply recording 4K video with the display set to max brightness.I characterized the GS5's display power as well for those of you who are interested. Note that all of this data was gathered with both cellular and WiFi connected, but all background sync tasks disabled. I'm not reporting absolute minimums here but rather an average over a short idle period.Galaxy S 5 Device Power vs. Display BrightnessMinimum Brightness 	200 nits 	Max Brightness 	Max Brightness (w/ Boost)Idle at Home Screen 	456.2mW 	591.2mW 	754.4mW 	1274.9mWIdle Displaying White 	453.2mW 	  	1517.4mW 	2148.0mWYou can see the impact content has on the AMOLED power draw by comparing the home/white rows. The GS5 display has a boost mode that kicks in when the ambient light sensor detects over 30,000 lux. The power penalty from running in this mode is pretty substantial as you'd expect. At worst, the GS5 will pull over 2W at idle while running in this max brightness boost mode. As is always the case, your display brightness has a big impact on battery life. If you run at max brightness you can conceivably run through your battery in 7 hours without doing anything at all. Run the display at 200 nits however (~60% on the GS5) and you can easily triple that battery life.Ultra Power Saving ModeThe Galaxy S 5 has two low power modes that can be manually triggered: power saving and ultra power saving. The former offers the usual control over the CPU governor, limiting max frequency to 1.5GHz but keeping all four cores plugged in. You can also force the display into grayscale mode and choose to block background data.Ultra power saving mode is the big new feature of the Galaxy S 5. In this mode all running apps are forced to quit, the display switches to grayscale mode, max brightness is clamped to 87 nits and the display refresh rate is reduced from 60Hz to 30Hz. When the screen turns off, ultra power saving mode turns off mobile data.WiFi and BT are also disabled upon entry (although you can manually re-enable them). Also in UPSM, Samsung disables two of the Krait 400 cores and caps the remaining two at 1.5GHz.You can only run a handful of apps in ultra power saving mode, including Samsung's own browser (Phone, Messages, Internet, Calculator, ChatON, Clock, Google+, Memo and Voice Recorder).Samsung claims that with only 10% left on your battery, switching into ultra power saving mode can give you up to 24 hours of standby time. To vet the claim I measured device power consumption while in UPSM. Just as before, this is total device power consumption measured at the battery.Galaxy S 5 Ultra Power Saving ModeSleep 	Idle (Home Screen) 	SunSpiderUltra Power Saving Mode 	16.8 mW 	421 mW 	1231.2 mWNormal Mode (min brightness) 	21.5 mW 	  	2461.5 mWAssuming a full battery can deliver 10.78Wh and a battery drained to 10% of that capacity only has 1.078Wh, if the GS5 consumes 16.8mW asleep with the display off on average I'd expect just over 64 hours of standby battery life - well above Samsung's claim of 24 hours. In reality, if you look at the power draw curve while sleeping the GS5 will wake up periodically and draw 200 - 300mW for a second or two. My guess is that's where the 24 hours of estimated time comes in.Now keep in mind that if you're actively using the device you'll see substantially higher power consumption. Running SunSpider in UPSM cuts platform power in less than half compared to normal mode with the display set to minimum brightness, so there's definitely a tangible benefit to UPSM even under active use. In the same 10% scenario from above, running a heavy web browser workload would kill your battery in 26 minutes normally or 52 minutes in ultra power saving mode. It's not a silver bullet but sometimes another 30 minutes of battery life is all you need.Battery LifeI put the Galaxy S 5 through our standard suite of battery life tests. As always, all of our battery life tests are run with the display set to 200 nits. We've documented our workloads in the past so I won't go through them again here. We're also working on populating our BaseMark OS II and GFXBench 3.0 battery life results so those charts may look a bit incomplete for now.The Galaxy S 5, like the new HTC One, sees a tremendous improvement in battery life thanks to the Snapdragon 801 platform. The move to an updated 28nm HPm process has a tangible impact on battery life compared to recent Snapdragon 800 designs. The increase in battery life compared to the Galaxy S 4 is incredible.We're also seeing a slight advantage to low power LTE battery life compared to WiFi in our test. Ultimately what this tells me is Snapdragon 801 is now fast enough to make our battery life test more display bound than anything else. It looks like it's time to build something new.The Galaxy S 5 falls behind the new HTC One by a little bit, especially if you consider the smaller capacity battery. I suspect this has more to do with display power consumption than anything else.Web Browsing Battery Life (4G LTE)Web Browsing Battery Life (WiFi)More often than not, when you�re faced with faster compute you end up doing more. To see what the other extreme of battery life looks like (where we aren't bound by display power) I turned to two canned tests: BaseMark OS II and GFXBench 3.0.I ran both of these tests under the same controlled conditions we always use, with all displays calibrated to 200 nits. BaseMark OS II runs through a bunch of CPU and storage benchmarks (basically the same tests used for the BaseMark OS II system and memory tests), as fast as possible, until the battery dies.I like this benchmark as it gives us an indication of worst case battery life if you�re absolutely hammering the CPU (and storage) relentlessly.BaseMark OS II Battery LifeGFXBench 3.0 Battery LifeWhile the M8 outlasted the Galaxy S 5 in our web browsing tests, the GS5 pulls ahead in our two compute bound tests. To better understand why, let's look at what happens to the GS5's performance over time during the GFXBench 3.0 test:GFXBench 3.0 Battery PerformanceWhile the M8's thermal chassis is able to dissipate heat nicely and keep the SoC running closer to full clocks, the GS5's plastic body acts as more of an insulator and forces GPU clocks down over the duration of the test. The result is a reduction in performance, but an increase in battery life. The Galaxy S 5 won't let you run the battery down as fast as you could due to thermal limitations of the chassis.Charge TimeSamsung includes a 5.3V/2A charger in the GS5's box along with a USB 3.0 cable. You can still charge the GS5 using a USB 2.0 cable as well. Despite an increase in battery capacity, the GS5 can attain a full charge in less than 2 hours. Combining excellent battery life with a very short charge time, the Galaxy S 5 is a solid performer for anyone who is on the go.Charge TimeGoogle Has Strangled The Innovation Out Of The Samsung Galaxy S5's TouchWiz UISamsung took to the stage at MWC this evening to introduce their next flagship smartphone. The Samsung Galaxy S5 will launch worldwide on April 11, and the South Korean company showed off the new hardware in Barcelona. The S5 hardware sports biometrics, fitness sensors, and waterproofing, along with a faster processor and improved screen when compared to the S4. What hasn�t changed is the user interface. Even if Samsung had wanted to bring a new paradigm to the platform, a recent agreement with Google forced the S5 to remain closely aligned to stock Android.The South Korean company has spent many years pushing TouchWiz, their own UI layer, onto the 200 million Galaxy S units sold, minimizing the moments where Google is visible to the customer and delivering an experience they believe is suitable for their user base. The problematic distance between Android and TouchWiz came to a head at this year�s CES with the announcement of the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro and Tab Pro, both sporting the new Magazine UX. A few days later Google and Samsung had signed a new global patent deal which included a number of restrictions on Samsung�s UI layer for Android.So it was with keen interest that I was watching the Galaxy S5 presentation this afternoon to see Samsung�s approach to the user interface after that agreement.Samsung Galaxy S5 (image: Samsung press)In Samsung�s words, the UI has been �refined to provide a clean and uncluttered look.� While the basic navigation is retained from the Galaxy S4, this more open and simple look is far closer to Google�s vision of a mobile UI than it is Samsung�s. The Galaxy S5 could easily have brought on board components of the Magazine UX to the 5.1 inch HD screen, it could have considered new presentational elements and paradigms that are proving a success on other handsets and mobile platforms, and it could have iterated on the user feedback of TouchWiz to create a newer and faster experience.Instead, Samsung has remained with a grid-based metaphor which forces users to go into an app, return to the home screen, and open another app. That does not sit well with the introduction of always connected peripherals (including the Gear 2 smartwatch and Gear Fit body tracker), a focus on photography, and improved connectivity to share more moments from life as quickly as possible,The Galaxy S5 does its best to stand out in hardware, but the majority of hardware is hidden behind the screen and the UI. Unfortunately Samsung has not been able to bring that same innovation to TouchWiz. As part of the aforementioned patent deal, Samsung agreed to �tone down TouchWiz, refocus on core Android apps over its own customisations, and cancel more radical customisations such as the magazine UX� (Forbes� Gordon Kelly has more on this). The biggest loser in this is surely the Galaxy S5.It�s unlikely that we will know the pressure Google placed Samsung under to bias the TouchWiz, and therefore the Galaxy S5, towards a stock Android look but I would have expected the UI on the S5 to have received just as much additional detail and improved functionality as the hardware inside the flagship smartphone has. Instead I see a device that on first glance is a very slightly bigger Galaxy S4 with a new wallpaper.Samsung has been forced to pass over an opportunity to really differentiate their handset in the public�s eye through software. While the S5 is likely to sell upwards of 40 million devices over the next twelve months, the smartphone looks almost identical to the S4, more than a passing resemblance to the S3, and will struggle to stand out against a sea of almost identical interfaces on competing Android devices.While the South Korean company has the lion�s share of Android sales, the ability to customise the user interface and how their smartphone actually works has been taken away from them. Samsung has found the limit of innovation in Android, Google has spoken, and as a result the Galaxy S5's software is a shadow of what it could have been.Samsung Galaxy S5 reviewSamsung goes for evolution over revolution... again.The Samsung Galaxy S5 can be defined by one word: evolution.The camera has evolved to give clearer, faster snaps. The fitness-tracking abilities of the S5 are enhanced over the Galaxy S4 by packing in a more powerful S Health app and a dedicated heart rate monitor on the rear. A fingerprint scanner adds to the most secure Galaxy phone ever made.Buy Samsung Galaxy S5 black 16GB at Amazon Germany for �378.99The battery is larger, the screen bigger and brighter, the processor quicker and the design altered.The spec sheet certainly doesn't let it down: a 2.5GHz quad-core CPU, 2GB of RAM, a 2800mAh (removable) battery, 16 / 32GB of memory (with up to 128GB extra through microSD), one of the world's most vibrant screens that's been extended to 5.1-inches and added biometrics.However, it's hard to point to one stand out feature that will grab the prospective user when they handle the Galaxy S5 for the first time.To many, that won't matter, as Samsung's built a fan-base that only Apple can rival, and a number will be picking up the new Galaxy without a second thought over whether it competes adequately with its rivals.But now - you can scrap all that. The Galaxy S6 is here, and it's a phone with a lot, lot more going for it.Hands on: Samsung Galaxy S6 reviewFor one, the design is awe-inspiring in comparison: the metal and glass edges might be a lot more iPhone-esque than Samsung's lawyers might like, but it's certainly a much nicer design.The power is much higher in the new phone, but it's shed the microSD slot and removable battery - plus the new S6 isn't waterproof. If those things are important to you, the S5 has dropped in price now and is a much better buy as a result.Already sold? Check out the best Samsung Galaxy S5 deals herePrice-wise, if you're shocked by the cost of the Samsung Galaxy S5 then you've not really been paying attention to the previous flagship models. It's actually a little cheaper than previous years in some territories, and has been dropped around more recently, coming in at around �370 these days SIM free in the UK.As you can imagine contract offers are flying all over the place at the moment, but the Galaxy S5 is being offered for a near identical price to the HTC One M8, and cheaper than the iPhone 6, give or take a few dollarpounds.The messaging around the launch of the Galaxy S5 was that Samsung had listened to the consumers and dialled down the gimmicks, focusing instead on what makes a phone special to the consumer.It promised a 'fashionable' and 'glam' design, a camera that works in the way you'd want it to and strength through being water resistant.There's also the small notion of an improved version - I was told that it was very likely the Galaxy S5 was going to launch with a Samsung Galaxy S5 Prime version in February, with oodles more RAM, a faster processor and QHD screen on board.However, that was pushed back (likely to do with issues in creating the screen in high enough volumes) and has since appeared in the South Korea-only Samsung Galaxy S5 LTE-A version. This one has a Snapdragon 805 CPU, a WQHD screen and all the high end features you can wish for. In short, it's the amazing phone I wish Samsung had announced originally and sold all over the world.You can always look at the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, a smaller phone with equal power to the main Galaxy S5, but with a lower-res 720p screen. That's offset by a metal design, although only around the edge of the phone - and Samsung has gone once again for a light weight, rather than making it feel weighty and ergonomic in the hand.That phone has a premium design fused with power under the hood - but with a sky high price and the lower-res screen it's clearly designed to compete with the all new iPhone 6.Is the Alpha better than the S5? Check out our Samsung Galaxy Alpha review to find out.And if you want something a little smaller, then the Galaxy S5 Mini is here now as well. It's a lot like the bigger brother, and the specs have only been dialled down slightly. It's not quite got the raw power but the design aesthetic is there and the heartbeat monitor as well - well worth checking out if you don't want to spend as much.But enough of the competition: let's look at one of the key questions that Samsung needed to answer with the Galaxy S5: is it good enough in market that's becoming saturated with decent high-end handsets?The simple answer, from the second you hold it in the hand, is no � because the design simply isn't up to the same level as the likes of Apple and HTC.That's only a small part of the story though, and underneath the hood Samsung has continued its play of stuffing all the latest specs in and optimising them in a way that doesn't suck down oodles of battery.Is this phone good enough to keep Samsung fighting with Apple at the top of the sales charts? Yes, but that's mostly through the impressive marketing machine that rolls out in every territory - and even that hasn't led to the greatest sales for the new phone.Samsung needs this to be the last phone that rolls with such design language (the Alpha and Note 4 show that this is the case and should continue) - the Galaxy S6 needs to be the dawn of a new age for the South Korean company, something to give consumers real lust for the way it looks.And with the new iPhone 6 being a real winner in the design stakes, if customers aren't wedded to the larger S5 screen then the lure of Apple has just grown stronger (although you should be looking at the myriad excellent Android phones first).This seems to have been picked up by the market at large given that Samsung recently reported that it has sold around 40 per cent less S5 handsets than it did with the Galaxy S4 at the same point in its lifecycle.The South Korean giant has responded to the news by stating that it plans to take a closer look at its smartphone strategy and concentrate on price tiers rather than high end handsets.What does that mean? Well, potentially we could see a further price drop in the near future that will make the Samsung Galaxy S5 an even more appealing prospect.Critically, and for the purposes of this review, it feels like there's very little to shout about with the Galaxy S5 � but perhaps that's no bad thing for a brand that was accused of bringing pointless innovation with last year's model.How Google Used Motorola To Smack Down Samsung -- TwiceSamsung is giant. It employs 427,000 staff, has an annual turnover in excess of $270bn and assets of $600bn spread across over 80 business units. And Google just floored it twice using Motorola as a baseball bat.Why?On the surface having 81 per cent of Android marketshare would seem to make Google and Samsung best buddies. Samsung has been the driving force behind Android�s meteoric growth and put Google mobile devices in pole position.The problem is Samsung wanted too much credit. It wasn�t enough for Samsung to make the most popular Android phones and tablets, it had to hide Android � and consequently Google�s role in its achievement. It did this using �TouchWiz�, the company�s proprietary skin which painted over all aspects of Android leaving it unrecognisable. To the casual consumer they were buying �a Samsung�, Google�s role was largely unrecognised.Then things got worse. Samsung began degrading Android performance by switching out vast parts of the software � phone dialler, calendar, email client, contacts, notification center, music and video player, voice control and much more � for its own apps. Reviews were largely negative with TouchWiz and its bloatware slowing down Android, wasting storage space and the replacement apps were seen as inferior or, worse still, needless gimmicks.Samsung then exploited this further. It put TouchWiz on its smart TVs, another market it dominates, and began building its own Android rival � Tizen � which, thanks to its TouchWiz interface, looks identical to the casual observer. The long term strategy was clear: switch over to Tizen and take the majority of the handset market with it. Google had to act.How?The �how� was Motorola. On 15 August 2011 Google announced it had bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5bn in cash. With it Google acquired more than 20,000 mobile patents and publicly declared the purchase of the phone maker would not in any way compromise relationships with its handset partners� honestly, really, pinky swear.Of course Google didn�t expect handset partners to fully believe this and platitudes issued from them in reaction to the deal confirmed it. Should Google use Motorola to ramp up its own major handset business the market would be theirs. The phones would have stock Android and no-one, not even Samsung, could afford to subsidise their cost as Google can leveraging its mammoth advertising revenue.The bait was set: obliteration by Google stock Android handsets unless manufacturers (read: Samsung) stopped messing with Android. Google quietly showed it could walk the walk as well as it ramped up Nexus production and introduced the well-received Motorola X and Motorola G which stripped away almost all customisation from stock Android.Samsung bit. On 27 January 2014 Google and Samsung signed a wide-ranging global patent deal which will last a decade. Buried within it was an agreement that Samsung would tone down TouchWiz, refocus on core Android apps over its own customisations and cancel more radical customisations such as its �Magazine UX� interface. Two days later Google announced the sale of Motorola Mobility to Lenovo showing both agreements had been working in parallel.The consequencesThe smack down for Samsung is twofold.Firstly, despite its size and dominance of the Android market, Samsung has been brought back into line. No longer will Samsung run roughshod over Android�s design, kick out its apps in favour of Samsung alternatives and hide Google�s hard work underneath. Indications of a low key Galaxy S5 launch suggest it will stand by its word.Secondly, the jump off point for Samsung from Android to Tizen is no longer straightforward. With Android shining through more strongly in future Samsung handsets it won�t be a seamless switch from one to the other. If Samsung wants Tizen to succeed it will now have to be earned rather than snuck in under the radar.All of which should be good news for Android users who will find it easier to move between handset makers when they upgrade while a stock Android experience (particularly with Android 4.4 KitKat�s optimisations) will make for faster, more responsive budget devices. Whether it gives smaller handset makers a greater chance to compete with the all-conquering Samsung, however, remains to be seen.And what of Google�s supposed $10bn loss? It�s a misreported myth calculated by subtracting Motorola�s $2.91bn sale price from its $12.5bn purchase. What it misses are the $3.2bn Motorola had in cash, $2.4bn saved in deferred tax assets and two separate Motorola unit sales totalling $2.5bn in 2013. Factor in Lenovo�s purchase against roughly $2bn of Motorola losses during Google�s ownership and Google has still only paid $3bn for what it retained: $5.5bn worth of Motorola patents and the company�s cutting edge research lab.Well played Google. Well played.Curious on what the deal means for Motorola and Lenovo? Read my new post: Lenovo Was Right To Buy Motorola � Just Look At ThinkPadCarriers Are Blocking One Of The Best Features Of Samsung's New Galaxy PhoneAT&T, Verizon, and Sprint are all blocking a very handy feature in Samsung's new flagship Galaxy S5 phone called Download Booster.Download Booster lets you use a combination of Wi-Fi and wireless 4G LTE data from your carrier to get insanely fast data speeds when downloading large files.In other words, if you wanted to see a movie on the Galaxy S5, you can download it at about five times cable modem speed.In our review of the Galaxy S5, we highlighted Download Booster as one of the best features in the new device.But those three U.S. carriers are blocking Download Booster, saying they need to test it more before they can let customers use it. In a statement to Business Insider, an AT&T spokesperson said: �We are evaluating Samsung�s Download Booster Feature. We thoroughly test new software, features and functionality to ensure that it meets our standards for a quality user experience.�A Verizon spokesperson also said the company is still evaluating Download Booster.Carriers have to approve of smartphone software before they agree to sell devices. If carriers think a feature might harm the user experience, it may block it. For example, carriers blocked the iPhone's video chat feature FaceTime when it first launched in 2010. It took a few years before carriers finally let customers use FaceTime over their data networks.We've reached out to Sprint for comment and will update if we hear back. The T-Mobile version of the Galaxy S5 lets you use Download Booster.One way the Galaxy S5 is better on T-Mobile than on other carriersOne of the many new features in the Galaxy S5 is something called Download Booster that Samsung says is �an innovative Wi-Fi technology for boosting data speed by bonding Wi-Fi and LTE simultaneously� that allows you to download data from two different connections at once. However, this cool new technology only works if your wireless carrier allows you to use it over their network and FierceWireless reports that Verizon, AT&T and Sprint have all disabled the feature on their versions of the Galaxy S5, which means you can use either LTE or Wi-Fi to download files onto your phone but you can�t use both at the same time.There is, however, one major American carrier that is not only allowing Download Booster on its version of the Galaxy S5 but is even touting it as part of its big Galaxy S5 promotion: T-Mobile. As FierceWireless notes, the �Uncarrier� has �highlighted the download booster in a Feb. 24 press release announcing that the S5 would be available from both T-Mobile and its MetroPCS business� and also �touts the feature on its S5 landing page.�So if you�re interested in buying a Galaxy S5 and you really want to see its Download Booster in action, it looks as though T-Mobile is your best bet as far as nationwide wireless carriers go.Big carriers remove Samsung�s �Download Booster� from the Galaxy S5Samsung loves to pack its phones with tons of software features, but one that customers won't get to see almost anywhere in the US is the new "Download Booster," which combines a user's Wi-Fi and LTE connection to speed up downloads. US carriers aren't overly fond of anything that might increase customers' data usage unless they can charge extra for it, so three out of the four major carriers have removed Download Booster from their devices.Between reports from Android Police and FierceWirelessTech, we have confirmation that AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon have all shipped the S5 without the feature. AT&T was quoted by FierceWirelessTech as saying, "We are evaluating Samsung's download booster feature. We thoroughly test new software, features, and functionality to ensure that it meets our standards for a quality user experience."We've seen many carriers step in to disable features they don't like. The most common example is putting a paywall in between a user and the mobile hotspot feature built into most mobile OSes or disabling video chat over the cellular connection. Still, it's been a while since we've seen an ISP exert such a high amount of control over the devices they sell.Even if the feature were available, we're not sure how useful it would be. If you are one of the few holdouts on a truly unlimited data plan, the download booster is probably right up your alley. But with a 20Mbps LTE connection and a 2GB monthly data limit, it's possible to blow through your monthly allowance in 15 minutes. So most of us carefully track our mobile data use�if a Wi-Fi connection is available, we'd gladly save our mobile bytes and download slightly slower over Wi-Fi only. Either way, the carriers get what they want.Your move Apple: Samsung opens up its fingerprint scanner to all appsSamsung's going to let developers use the Galaxy S5's fingerprint scanner in their own apps, which means you could be waving goodbye to your passwords for good.The fingerprint-friendly Pass API was released as part of the S5's development kit, which also includes all the information devs need to create apps for the Gear 2 and Gear Fit.The fingerprint scanner was already more useful than most, allowing you to control certain parts of the phone with your biometric data, and more apps being able to access the info will certainly attract consumers.Pass out"With Pass, you can provide reinforced security, since you can identify whether the current user actually is the authentic owner of the device," the document explains.PayPal is the first to make use of the open API; its app lets you use your phone and fingerprint scanner combo to pay for things in participating stores.Unlike Samsung, Apple's TouchID has stayed tightly guarded so you can only use it to unlock your iPhone 5S and authorise payments in Apple's own products like iBooks, iTunes and the App Store.Samsung Galaxy S5 preview: simpler in some ways, more 'glam' in othersOnce a year, Samsung takes some of its best material and slaps it together into a premium flagship model called the Galaxy S. While 2014's version -- the S5 -- came a bit earlier in the year than some earlier iterations, we're no less excited to see it become the star of the show at Mobile World Congress. The new device will ship in April (on stage, Samsung specifically mentioned that it launches on April 11th in 150 markets), although exact pricing and availability are still unknown. It features a refreshed design language, yet anyone who has used a GS phone recently will immediately recognize it as a Samsung flagship.Despite its familiar design, the GS5 has a few new useful hardware features, including a fingerprint scanner, heart rate sensor, and a toned-down TouchWiz UI on top of Android 4.4 KitKat. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all, however, was that Samsung didn't overload its prized new smartphone with a heaping dose of new S-branded features. This is a marked departure from the company's previous strategy of cramming in every software feature under the sun, which leads us to wonder if this is related to Samsung's recent agreement to dial back the customization it does on Android devices. So what else is new here? Read on for a deeper dive.Once a year, Samsung takes some of its best material and slaps it together into a premium flagship model called the Galaxy S.

So what else is new here? Read on for a deeper dive.Gallery | 12 PhotosS5+ See all 12The new Galaxy retains the same 1080p Super AMOLED panel as the GS4; it's just slightly larger, at 5.1 inches. With this in mind, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the viewing experience is pretty much the same as its predecessor. Additionally, the GS5 comes with a swappable back cover, microSD slot and removable 2,800mAh battery, which has a higher capacity than last year's model. It's also IP67-certified, which adds an element of water and dust resistance never before enjoyed by Galaxy S users (unless you count the GS4 Active, that is). As a result, the micro-USB 3.0 port at the bottom is protected by a tab that keeps water from getting inside.Samsung says the back of the GS5 is "leather-like," which basically means it's a fancy-looking polycarbonate build. While the company already uses similar design language for the Galaxy Note 3 and Note 10.1 2014 edition, the look and feel is slightly different; it's not quite as soft as the new Notes, and its small dimples actually remind us of the original Nexus 7. Though the sides have a metallic finish, company reps confirmed they're actually made from a blend of polycarbonate and glass fiber. Still, we're more confident of the durability here than we were with many of Samsung's previous Galaxy phones.One of the biggest talking points for the GS5 is that new fingerprint scanner. It's easy to see this as a response to Apple's Touch ID implementation in the iPhone 5s, and while it's hard to say if that was the primary motivation for the new feature, Apple's not the only manufacturer to have integrated a fingerprint scanner, and we're sure it won't be the last. In this case, Samsung's scanner, which works by swiping your finger down over the home button, has a few handy use cases. In addition to the obligatory phone unlock option, it also lets you fingerprint-protect a private data locker on your phone, in case you have confidential information you don't want getting out there. Samsung also announced a partnership with PayPal which allows you to make online payments using the fingerprint method. In our limited time with the GS5, I noticed that the phone picked up my fingerprint most of the time, as long as I did it slowly enough -- if you're in a swiping hurry, your chance of success will likely drop. Unfortunately, we're still waiting to hear back on exactly how Samsung will implement security and privacy concerns with the scanner, so we'll update you as soon as we know more details.The other major new hardware feature is the heart rate sensor, which is built into the same rear module as the LED flash. It works in conjunction with S-Health 3.0, which acts as a personal life coach of sorts. To monitor your pulse, hold your finger up to the sensor and leave it there while the phone does the rest of the work. As you continue to do this more often, S-Health remembers your history and even goes through the effort of graphing it and offering up other relevant information. It also acts as a pedometer and food monitor. Samsung plans to offer an open SDK for developers to incorporate the tech into their own apps.Of course, Samsung also put some emphasis on the camera as well. In this case, the GS5 comes with a 16-megapixel sensor that features UHD recording capability and real-time HDR (both photos and video) and a couple new modes that we're excited to review. First, Samsung is introducing a selective focus feature that's much like Nokia's Refocus Lens, in which you can change the depth of field on an image after it's taken. Additionally, it also has "Shot & More," which is essentially your standard suite of best photo, eraser and drama; the GS4 had the ability to do these modes, but the difficulty was in the fact that you had to know exactly which mode you wanted to use before taking the shot, whereas now you'll be able to sort those details out after the shot is taken so you're not wasting extra time. Lastly, there's also a 2.0-megapixel camera on the front.The design philosophy behind this version of the Galaxy S involves a modern, glam look, and it even shows in the user interface. It's still very much a TouchWiz device, but it has a much different appearance than previous versions. It seems to be less in-your-face (again, a likely consequence of Google's intervention) with fewer tabs and menus. My Magazine is still around, but it's now accessible by swiping from left to right, not down to up.The rest of the phone's stats won't come as any shock. The GS5 offers a top-of-the-line 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801 processor with 2GB of RAM, an IR remote, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 BLE/ANT+, Cat 4 LTE (up to 150Mbps down/50Mbps up) and your choice of 16GB or 32GB of internal storage; oddly, 64GB doesn't appear to be an option, though you can add up to 128GB via a microSD card if needed. All told, it's very much a run-of-the-mill Galaxy S flagship, but there are enough new hardware features and software tweaks to make it feel fresh.Android 5.0 Lollipop starts to flavor Samsung Galaxy S5Latest edition of Android pops up in Poland for the GS5 and should wend its way through Europe before too long, says SamMobile.Android 5.0 Lollipop has apparently begun its worldwide tour to reach owners of Samsung's Galaxy S5.Released by Google on November 3, the latest flavor of Google's mobile operating system is now available for the GS5 in Poland, blog site SamMobile said Wednesday. Poland has been used by mobile device makers as a starting point to test out new Android updates before it spreads around the world. As such, the Polish launch is a good sign that Lollipop should soon start to pop up in other regions.The Polish version of the Galaxy S5 has the same model number as the version used in Europe, according to blog site SlashGear, which means European users could be next on the list. Samsung is also likely to launch Android 5.0 in its home base of South Korea at some point in the near future.A similar scenario has played out with LG's G3 smartphone. Owners of the phone residing in Poland were first on the list to receive a bite of Lollipop. Just a couple of weeks later, G3 owners in South Korea started seeing the update appear on their devices. Android 5.0 could reach GS5 owners in other regions before the month and year are over.The US is a different story, however. Android updates in the US can take awhile as they have to be tested by not only the device makers but also the mobile carriers who must also certify and plan the rollout. As such, Galaxy S5 owners in the US are unlikely to get a lick of Lollipop until 2015.Android 5.0 is likely on the wish list of many Android users in part because it offers several changes, among them a new design aesthetic with animations and other visual effects. Notifications now appear on the lock screen. A new menu called Overview shows running apps as a stack of cards, and a new Battery Saver mode drills down the CPU and turns off background data when a device is running low on juice.Motorola already started deploying Android 5.0 for its Moto X and Moto G phones in November. Google also started the update for its existing Nexus devices, such as the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphones and the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets, but some users will have to wait awhile. A Google+ post from November 12 said that "the Android Lollipop rollout has started and will soon be available on most Nexus devices in the coming weeks."Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Samsung Galaxy S5 Sport review:The Good Samsung's Galaxy S5 Sport has a grippy backing and responsive physical controls, and it comes in vibrant colors. It has nearly all of the Samsung Galaxy S5's software and specs.The Bad Data is slow if you aren't in Sprint's LTE data footprint. The Sport lacks the convenience key of AT&T's S5 Active. A mountain of preloaded apps makes setup a drag.The Bottom Line Sprint's Samsung Galaxy S5 Sport inches ahead of the original S5 by combining identical performance in a slightly more polished package.hat's the difference between the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sprint's exclusive Galaxy S5 Sport? Mostly the bright blue or red paint job; the slightly rubberized design with physical rather than touch-sensitive controls; and preloaded fitness-related apps, like Sprint Fit Live, that wrap in some limited-time subscriptions to various services.That's about it. You still get the 5.1-inch 1080p display, an excellent 16-megapixel camera, a 2.5GHz quad-core processor, a heart-rate monitor, and Android 4.4 OS with Samsung's OS on top. The only thing you lack is a fingerprint scanner, which I personally don't miss. Pricing remains identical to the Galaxy S5: $200 on contract, and $27.09 per month for 24 months, or $650 all-in.For my money, even if I never intend to dive into the fitness features, I'd buy the Sport over the regular S5 for the looks alone.Samsung Galaxy S5 Sport fits right inI like everything about the way that the Galaxy S5 Sport looks, from the rich blue or red shade (I reviewed it in red) to the row of physical navigation buttons below the screen, to the dimpled, slightly rubberized back plate that makes it grippier than the original. I raked my nails all over the backing without leaving a dent, though the combination matte-and-shiny corners seem as scuffable as most phones.Compared to the Galaxy S5, the Sport looks edgier and feels more secure in the hand. Its volume and power buttons rise higher from the surface and are easier to press, and it does all this while sacrificing only one feature, the S5's fingerprint scanner (which I was never enamored with in the first place).One other tiny difference is that the S5 Sport, like AT&T's S5 Active, has a single Micro-USB charging port rather than the S5's double-barrel USB/MHL combo port. My one disappointment is that the Sport lacks the Active's programmable convenience key on the left edge, which pulls up the camera and Activity Zone app when you give it a long or short press, respectively.Like the standard S5, the Sport has a crisp, colorful 5.1-inch 1080p HD AMOLED display, a 16-megapixel camera on the back and 2-megapixel camera on the front, LED flash, an IR blaster, a heart-rate monitor, and a 3.5 millimeter headset jack.At 5.67 inches tall by 2.91 inches wide by 0.35-inch thick, the Sport is ever-so-slightly shorter and ever-so-slightly wider than the Active. At 5.57 ounces, it's also a tad lighter than the Active's 6-ounce weight. Both fitness-focused variants measure a bit bulkier than the S5 original (5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32-inches and 5.11 ounces).Also like both those models, the Sport's IP67 rating makes it resistant to shock, dust, and submersion for 30 minutes in a meter of water; about 3 feet.OS and appsSamsung's TouchWiz interface rides on top of Android 4.4, bringing a host of settings and software options to the S5 Sport. In addition to Samsung's caboodle, which you can read about in my S5 review, Sprint has absolutely stuffed the Sport with partner apps, including a few aimed at "people with active lifestyles."Sprint Fit Live is at the forefront of the mix, a carrier-branded hub to showcase partners Under Armour, Spotify, and MapMyFitness. The app, which you open in full or as a widget, contains two parts. The first section amalgamates Samsung's S Health app, Spotify (for workout mixes), and MapMyFitness into a dashboard. The second portion, Smart Health, spoons out articles related to human health.Partnerships are at the app's core. You'll get a free year of MapMyFitness MVP, owned by Under Armour. You'll also get 6 months of Spotify's premium service for free, if you're on a Framily plan, or 3 months if you're not. These "deals" don't impress me much, since their objective is so clearly to convert you into a yearly paid subscriber. There's nothing wrong with companies trying to run a business; it just adds little value for me personally.If you are interested in any of these tools, good news. You won't have to download Sprint Fit Live, but here's the catch. If you want to use it, you're tied to the default Under Armour wallpaper that comes preloaded on the phone. Yes, you can toggle the cheesy "inspirational" messages on and off, and use your own Gallery photos instead of images of athletes being sporty, but it seems like Sprint would want to make the download of a standalone app an option for use with other wallpapers. It doesn't matter too much either way, since standalone apps exist on their own.In addition to the aforementioned fitness apps, there's Samsung's Activity Zone with a compass, barometer, and flashlight (the S5 Active has this too); Lumen Toolbar; Sprint ID; Sprint Zone; Wi-Fi calling; Amazon and eBay; Eureka Offers; Messaging+; NextRadio; Scout, 1Weather; more Sprint apps; Lookout Security; and Flipboard. Whew! If those app tray icons don't blur your vision, Sprint has also prestocked an entire home screen with several of those icons, plus a Featured Apps widget showcasing eight more.Samsung Galaxy S5 Active (AT&T)By Eugene KimLast year's Galaxy S4$199.88 at Amazon and S4 Active seemed like a natural pairing, but with water-resistance now a standard feature on the Galaxy S5Free at Amazon, you might be wondering why Samsung even bothered with an Active variant this year. The big difference, really, is as much form as function: The S5 Active carries a heartier MIL-spec 810G rating, meaning it can take on more physical abuse. But it also just looks and feels like a nicer device to me, even though it's the same price as the standard GS5. This, of course, is a matter of personal preference, but the two are so close in size that taste really should be the deciding factor. Both GS5s are excellent smartphones�choose the one that fits your needs.Design and Activity ZoneNearly every feature from the standard GS5 makes its way to the Active. The display, processor, cameras, wireless radios, and software are all identical between the two, so head over to the original review for an in-depth look at those features. We'll focus on the design changes and additional or missing features here.The S5 Active takes on a more rugged look than last year's device with more pronounced, reinforced corners. Smaller details like etched-in grips and faux-rivets, combined with the camouflage green finish of our review unit, give the S5 Active a decidedly tactical feel. At 5.72 by 2.89 by 0.35 inches (HWD), the Active is shorter than the regular S5 and a hair wider and thicker, but it's also far more compact than the regular S5 with a rugged case slapped on top. It's also nearly a full ounce heavier at 6 ounces, but the added density inspires more confidence in its durability over the long run. The gaudy faux-chrome accents and dimpled back cover are gone, neither of which I particularly liked on the regular S5. I much prefer the matte plastics and tactile accents on the Active. AT&T offers the active in the aforementioned camo green and in more neutral gray or red colorways.View all 6 photos in galleryWith IP67 waterproofing and a MIL-spec 810G rating, the S5 Active should be as durable as it looks. The military specification means the S5 Active has been tested against dust, shock, vibration, extreme temperatures, humidity, and high-altitude. The most meaningful durability claim is its shock resistance�Samsung claims that the S5 Active can hold up to drops from up to 4 feet onto a flat surface. I subjected the S5 Active to a round of drops and throws inside our labs, ranging from 3 to 5 feet, onto a relatively hard surface. The back cover popped open a bit after some serious abuse, but the phone never looked worse for wear and functioned perfectly afterwards.The micro USB port still has that pesky flap, but I found it easier to open thanks to the notch facing forward instead of to the side. The back still peels off to reveal the SIM and microSD card slots as well as the removable 2,800mAh battery, which is the same size as the one in the standard GS5. Battery life approached 20 hours of continuous talk time in our tests, and the Ultra Power Saving Mode is still here, offering up to 4 hours of intermittent use out of the last 2 percent of battery.I'm partial to on-screen navigation buttons, but the physical Recent Apps, Home, and Back buttons on the S5 Active have their appeal. They feel well-seated and have a satisfyingly clicky feedback, and I was never a fan of Samsung's combination of capacitive and physical buttons on the standard GS5 to begin with. The Power button is on the right edge, while the Volume buttons are joined by a new "Active key" on the left edge.inlineBy default, the Active key launches Samsung's Activity Zone, a new app that puts barometric measurements and GPS coordinates front and center, with easy access to flashlight and stopwatch apps�you know, things active people might be interested in. Luckily, Samsung allows you to re-program the key to launch any two apps installed on your device, using either a short or long press. I love this feature; it's like the Kickstarter-backed Pressy button, except it's real, and it works without occupying your headphone jack. It's especially useful for underwater photography, since the touch screen doesn't work when wet.The heart-rate monitor is still here, but the fingerprint scanner didn't make the cut. That's fine as far as I'm concerned, since the swiping motion was always a bit awkward and inconvenient whenever I used it on the regular GS5. The earpiece and back-ported speaker are, as far as I can tell, identical between the GS5 and Active, and call quality is indistinguishable between the two. There's a more robust lip around the camera lens, but image quality is also identical.Our 16GB model came with 10.91GB available to users out of the box. There's still a good deal of bloatware here courtesy of AT&T and Samsung. These include redundant services like AT&T Locker and Navigator, as well as Samsung media and app portals. Yellow Pages, Beats Music, and Lookout Security are also preinstalled, and none of these are removable. There's no more bloatware here than on the normal GS5, at least.ConclusionsThe Galaxy S5 Active makes no real compromises to earn its more adventurous designation. I don't care for fingerprint scanners, and I think the Active key will be genuinely more useful for the majority of people. Otherwise, it offers the exact same experience as the standard GS5. I personally prefer the S5 Active's design, and the added weight makes it feel like a more premium device in my hands. Either would make a fine choice, but if you're a klutz or adrenaline junkie, the Active should jump to the top of your list. It shares our Editors' Choice award with its otherwise identical, non-Active sibling on AT&T.Samsung Galaxy S5 Active just got a 'Sport'-y new name on SprintThe Samsung Galaxy S5 Active is already only rudimentarily different from the standard Galaxy S5, and now a third variant is being introduced by Samsung and Sprint.But the Galaxy S5 Sport, as it's called, is even less different from the S5 Active than the Active was from the original.In fact, it's more or less identical, with the new name being the only discernible difference.The carrier is nevertheless calling the Galaxy S5 Sport an "exclusive," so that's fun.Not this againTo be fair, there are aspects of the S5 Sport - including available colors and included apps - that are actually exclusive to Sprint.The Sprint phone will come in "cherry red" and "electric blue," and it's pre-loaded with a new Sprint Fit Live fitness app package in addition to the Active's Activity Zone, S Health and heart rate monitorLike the S5 Active, the S5 Sport has IP67 water and dust resistance, a step up from the standard S5's slightly less effective water resistance.The Sport also has the Active's upgraded "textured casing."It arrives "exclusively" on Sprint July 25. Let's just hope other carriers don't follow suit and spark a resurgence of naming every phone something different for each of their networks.The best Samsung Galaxy S5 dealsSamsung Galaxy S5 review: a solid improvement, but don't rush to upgradeWhen Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S5 and a trio of Gear smartwatches, the company made a big to-do about how it listens to its customers. We know, we know: Every company's supposed to be doing that. But remember, this is Samsung we're talking about. It dominates the Android market by such a wide margin that it makes rivals like LG and HTC look like quaint startups. Put it another way: Samsung could release a phone with no improvements, and it'd still sell millions.At least, that's how it used to be. The smartphone market has seen a downturn of late and even mighty Samsung has been affected. Sales are down, and the manufacturer must now make phones that give people what they actually want (shocker, we know). So what can we expect from a humbled Samsung? A durable phone that brings a toned-down TouchWiz UI, a better camera, longer battery life, improved performance, a fingerprint scanner and enhanced health tracking. I received an unlocked review unit from GSM Nation, which was the first outlet to start shipping the phone in the US with AT&T- and T-Mobile-compatible LTE. Now that I've been testing it for a few days, let's see if the Galaxy S5 lives up to all those promises.SamsungGalaxy S5ProsFantastic displayDaylight images are on par with other flagship phonesWaterproof casing and improved designGood battery lifeConsFingerprint scanner can be frustratingSelective focus doesn't always work as promisedHeart rate monitor isn't completely accurateTouchWiz UI looks better, but is still confusingSummaryThe S5 is a solid upgrade over last year's model, with improvements to the hardware, software and camera. However, certain headline features like the fingerprint scanner and heart rate monitor are mediocre at best. Chances are, you'll be happy with the phone, but don't fork out the extra cash for an early upgrade.If you've seen one Galaxy S device, you've seen 'em all. Each iteration of the popular smartphone series has had a few nips and tucks, but overall it's maintained the same look over the years. The S5 is no exception: The only new features here are its squarish shape and its plastic, waterproof casing -- dimpled to look sort of like leather (it doesn't really). Even then, you can tell at a glance that it's a Galaxy S.If there's one word we'd use to describe the Galaxy S5 design, it's "inoffensive." It's not exactly a visual treat like the new HTC One M8, but it's not ugly either. And that's not surprising, really: Samsung usually plays it safe with its designs. This time around, I've heard plenty of jokes referring to the GS5 as the "Band-Aid Phone," a nod to those dimples on the back. Truly, though, I only see that in certain colors, especially the gold version. Fortunately, my white unit doesn't look like a Band-Aid at all; in fact, I prefer it to the glossy covers used on the GS3 and GS4.Indeed, there's something to having a less slippery design: I was able to grip the 8.1mm-thick phone without feeling like it was going to slip through my fingers. In particular, the blunt edges and mostly flat back make it easy to wrap your fingers around the device. And that's a good thing, since the GS5 is larger than its predecessor in every way (5mm taller, almost 3mm wider and 0.2mm thicker). In other words, if you thought the GS4 was too large, this year's version may be too much. It's also 0.52 ounce (15g) heavier, but I only noticed the difference when I was holding one device in each hand. And besides, by modern-day standards it's compact: Compared to the One M8, the GS5 is shorter, thinner and lighter, and that's with a slightly larger screen, too.I mentioned earlier that the GS5 is waterproof. More specifically, it's IP67-certified, which means it can be immersed in up to one meter of water for up to 30 minutes. But before you decide to take it for a swim, make sure to close the back using the rubber gasket and seal the charging port. Curiously, the headphone jack is completely open, but somehow is impervious to water.There are only a few changes to the button layout, compared to last year's GS4. The power button and volume rocker are still on the right and left, respectively. There's now a micro-USB 3.0/MHL 2.0 port on the bottom, which is protected by a waterproof tab. The IR blaster, meanwhile, sits on the top left, with the 3.5mm headphone jack over on the top right. Additionally, the home button now includes a capacitive fingerprint sensor, which I'll discuss in more detail later on. Around back you'll find the small speaker grille, but the biggest change can be found farther up: Samsung installed a heart rate monitor next to the LED flash, just underneath the rear camera.As ever, Samsung included a removable back cover and a swappable battery, with a capacity of 2,800mAh (up from 2,600mAh). There's also a microSD slot for up to 128GB of external storage. Out of the box, you get either 16GB or 32GB of built-in storage; just remember that the operating system takes up a lot of space before you even get around to installing apps or downloading movies. In fact, my 16GB unit had a little under 12GB of space when I started using it, so if you're even slightly concerned about storing large files, I recommend going with the 32GB model or buying a big memory card to compensate.I won't spend a lot of time on connectivity because it will ultimately vary depending on where you live and which carrier you use (that last bit is particularly true in the US). That said, most variants feature quad-band GSM/EDGE, quad-band HSPA+ 42.2 Mbps (850/900/1900/2100) and LTE Cat 4 (which offers speeds of up to 150 Mbps). The GS5 also supports carrier aggregation, which basically means that it can fuse together LTE from different towers to increase your data speeds. But again, this will largely depend on whether your carrier even supports that technology.Finally, you'll also get Bluetooth 4.0 + LE, GPS/GLONASS, DLNA, USB OTG, MHL 2.0 and WiFi Direct. There's also dual-band WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, but the GS5 is the first phone that we've seen with two-channel MIMO support. In English, it includes an extra antenna, with which you could theoretically double your speed -- provided you have the right kind of supporting equipment, of course.Oh, and while I'm on the subject of speed, most versions of the GS5 come with a new feature called Download Booster, which essentially combines the power of LTE, WiFi and Grayskull to help large files download faster than they would on any one connection. The service won't work on anything smaller than 30MB, and doesn't apply to certain protocols like FTP and UDP. But if you're trying to install an app, load a YouTube video or save a movie your cousin shared with you on Facebook, Download Booster should do the trick. If you don't have an unlimited data plan, however, be very careful about how often you use this -- if you're not keeping tabs on your usage, your next bill might give you an aneurysm.DisplayThe S5's 5.1-inch Full HD Super AMOLED display has the same resolution as last year's flagship despite the larger size screen. Yes, pixel-density snobs, that means you're subjected to nine fewer pixels per inch (441 vs. 432). In any case, those nine pixels were worth the sacrifice: The display here is a surprising improvement over the S4. The difference is easy enough to see with the naked eye, especially when you put the two devices side by side.For starters, the S5 is much brighter than the S4, not only indoors, but also in direct sunlight (with auto-brightness turned on, the display goes up to around 450 nits). At the same time, it's also capable of dimming down to as low as two nits in pitch-black rooms. This makes for a more comfortable viewing experience when you're reading in a dark bedroom or (tsk, tsk) catching up on Facebook during a movie. The viewing angles have improved significantly as well: Even from a severe angle, the colors are more lifelike, and it's easier to read onscreen text. Admittedly, the HTC One M8's S-LCD panel does a better job with whites and darks, although the GS5 offers more color saturation (and it's not even over-the-top saturation this time, either). As you can see, I'm being rather nitpicky here, but I believe most users will be happy with either display.And if you're not happy? Unlike most non-Samsung phones (save for Nokia), the GS5 has five screen modes: Professional Photo, Cinema, Dynamic, Adapt and Standard. They all use a different color gamut; so if one doesn't fit your fancy, try the others to see what works best.Fingerprint scannerUntil the iPhone 5s came out, the last flagship phone with a fingerprint scanner was the Motorola Atrix 4G -- and that was three years ago. Back then, it was clear the technology wasn't ready for prime time, mostly because the sensors didn't actually work very well. Now, in 2014, the S5 comes with a capacitive fingerprint scanner built into the home button -- yep, just like on the iPhone. It remains to be seen if this leads to another court battle, but regardless, you can't fault Samsung for choosing the home button: We touch that part of the phone dozens (if not hundreds) times a day.So, how exactly does the scanner work here? Samsung's setup features Synaptics' Natural ID, which consists of a tiny sensor that sits underneath the button. (Synaptics calls it "a miniature touchpad with built-in capacitive sensing.") When it's time for the phone to learn your prints, you swipe your finger over the home button several times, allowing the sensor to read the inner live layers of the tip of your finger. Using signal strength, the sensor can draw a "map" of your fingerprint and presto -- you're all set. You can store up to three prints total, although I'd prefer even more.If the sensor doesn't recognize your finger after five attempts, the phone will prompt you to enter an alternative password. It's an alphanumeric password, mind, so you'll have to include both numbers and letters instead of a simple four-digit PIN code. On one hand (no pun intended), Samsung likely did it this way to make the phone more secure, but I still believe users should be able to choose what type of password they want.Speaking of security, should we be concerned about privacy? According to Samsung and Synaptics, the answer is no. When the sensor talks to the processor ("Hey, this print checks out just fine. Go ahead and let them in."), all information is encrypted. What's more, the prints are stored locally on the phone, and instead of storing an actual image of your print, it only logs a virtual map. Spoofing also wouldn't work; Synaptics says that any change in the physical properties of the phone will result in rejection.All in all, Samsung makes more use out of its fingerprint scanner than Apple does with Touch ID. Both the GS5 and iPhone 5s use the scanner to unlock the phone, obviously, but that's where the similarities end. The only other thing Touch ID can do is approve App Store and iTunes downloads. Samsung, meanwhile, lets you make online payments through PayPal, as well as access a private "locker" for confidential files. I'd also like to see these companies open up their sensors to third-party developers; all in due time, hopefully.When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S5 and a trio of Gear smartwatches, the company made a big to-do about how it listens to its customers.

I'd also like to see these companies open up their sensors to third-party developers; all in due time, hopefully.Getting down to brass tacks, how well does the thing actually work? It depends. I trained the GS5 to recognize both of my thumbs and my right index finger, since those are the three digits I use the most when waking up the phone. Over the course of several days, I made dozens of attempts with each finger and it only recognized me on the first try about half the time -- and that's a generous estimate. More often than not, I had to swipe my finger two or three times before it let me in; typing in a PIN code would've been more efficient. Worse, there were other times when the scanner wouldn't recognize me at all, even as I adjusted my swipe speed, angle and finger pressure. And even when it works, there's a small delay after you swipe before the phone accepts your print.As for one-handed use, don't even bother. It's technically possible, but the odds of success are so low I have a better chance of seeing Narnia each time I open my closet. Normally, I hold the phone in my left hand and try to swipe the sensor with my left thumb; however, my thumb is at such an angle that the sensor simply can't recognize it. Sometimes it'll work if I push the phone up a little higher and try to position the thumb at a more shallow angle, but even then, it takes multiple attempts, and it's so off-balance that I've come close to dropping the device several times. Apple's sensor, on the other hand, has no problem picking up my fingerprint from any angle.To be fair, my experience may get better over time (although in Apple's case, it got worse for a while). It's obvious there's a learning curve here; it can take practice to place your finger in just the right place, at just the right speed with just the right amount of pressure. However, I don't believe most people will be that patient -- after a few frustrating attempts, users might simply turn the feature off (or worse, attempt a warranty swap because they think it's defective).There's a bit of a silver lining, at least: If you don't like it, don't want to use it or it simply doesn't work for you (or all of the above), you don't have to use it. And unlike the HTC One Max, whose fingerprint scanner sits below the rear camera, the sensor itself isn't visually distracting.Heart rate monitorSamsung's been making a big deal about health recently. It's offered an app called S Health for quite some time, which helps users track their exercise and food intake. Starting with the GS4 in particular, the app's been able to monitor heart rate and steps with the help of third-party accessories. Now, though, both of these features are built directly into the GS5, giving you one or two fewer fitness gadgets to carry around. That said, the heart rate monitors built into the new Gear 2 and Gear Fit smartwatches integrate with S Health, so the company's hoping you'll buy some fitness wearables after all (so long as they're made by Samsung, of course).To get started, go to the Heart Rate section of S Health. Then, once prompted, put your finger over the sensor, keep still and stay quiet. Be careful where you put your finger, though: The sensor, which uses a light that allows it to "see" and measure your pulse, is positioned almost directly beneath the camera lens. Without your eyes directly guiding your finger to the right place, it's easy to mistake the camera lens for the heart rate monitor. (Pro tip: You'll want to keep a cloth handy to wipe off the lens if you do this a lot.) As with the fingerprint scanner, positioning is crucial. If my finger was even slightly off, the monitor couldn't measure my pulse and I'd have to redo it. When you've done it right, you'll know pretty quickly since it only takes five seconds or so to complete the process.When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S5 and a trio of Gear smartwatches, the company made a big to-do about how it listens to its customers. We know, we know: Every company's supposed to be doing that. But remember, this is Samsung we're talking about. It dominates the Android market by such a wide margin that it makes rivals like LG and HTC look like quaint startups. Put it another way: Samsung could release a phone with no improvements, and it'd still sell millions.At least, that's how it used to be. The smartphone market has seen a downturn of late and even mighty Samsung has been affected. Sales are down, and the manufacturer must now make phones that give people what they actually want (shocker, we know). So what can we expect from a humbled Samsung? A durable phone that brings a toned-down TouchWiz UI, a better camera, longer battery life, improved performance, a fingerprint scanner and enhanced health tracking. I received an unlocked review unit from GSM Nation, which was the first outlet to start shipping the phone in the US with AT&T- and T-Mobile-compatible LTE. Now that I've been testing it for a few days, let's see if the Galaxy S5 lives up to all those promises.Gallery | 45 PhotosSamsung Galaxy S5 review+ See all 4583SamsungGalaxy S5ProsFantastic displayDaylight images are on par with other flagship phonesWaterproof casing and improved designGood battery lifeConsFingerprint scanner can be frustratingSelective focus doesn't always work as promisedHeart rate monitor isn't completely accurateTouchWiz UI looks better, but is still confusingSummaryThe S5 is a solid upgrade over last year's model, with improvements to the hardware, software and camera. However, certain headline features like the fingerprint scanner and heart rate monitor are mediocre at best. Chances are, you'll be happy with the phone, but don't fork out the extra cash for an early upgrade.If you've seen one Galaxy S device, you've seen 'em all. Each iteration of the popular smartphone series has had a few nips and tucks, but overall it's maintained the same look over the years. The S5 is no exception: The only new features here are its squarish shape and its plastic, waterproof casing -- dimpled to look sort of like leather (it doesn't really). Even then, you can tell at a glance that it's a Galaxy S.If there's one word we'd use to describe the Galaxy S5 design, it's "inoffensive." It's not exactly a visual treat like the new HTC One M8, but it's not ugly either. And that's not surprising, really: Samsung usually plays it safe with its designs. This time around, I've heard plenty of jokes referring to the GS5 as the "Band-Aid Phone," a nod to those dimples on the back. Truly, though, I only see that in certain colors, especially the gold version. Fortunately, my white unit doesn't look like a Band-Aid at all; in fact, I prefer it to the glossy covers used on the GS3 and GS4.Indeed, there's something to having a less slippery design: I was able to grip the 8.1mm-thick phone without feeling like it was going to slip through my fingers. In particular, the blunt edges and mostly flat back make it easy to wrap your fingers around the device. And that's a good thing, since the GS5 is larger than its predecessor in every way (5mm taller, almost 3mm wider and 0.2mm thicker). In other words, if you thought the GS4 was too large, this year's version may be too much. It's also 0.52 ounce (15g) heavier, but I only noticed the difference when I was holding one device in each hand. And besides, by modern-day standards it's compact: Compared to the One M8, the GS5 is shorter, thinner and lighter, and that's with a slightly larger screen, too.I mentioned earlier that the GS5 is waterproof. More specifically, it's IP67-certified, which means it can be immersed in up to one meter of water for up to 30 minutes. But before you decide to take it for a swim, make sure to close the back using the rubber gasket and seal the charging port. Curiously, the headphone jack is completely open, but somehow is impervious to water.There are only a few changes to the button layout, compared to last year's GS4. The power button and volume rocker are still on the right and left, respectively. There's now a micro-USB 3.0/MHL 2.0 port on the bottom, which is protected by a waterproof tab. The IR blaster, meanwhile, sits on the top left, with the 3.5mm headphone jack over on the top right. Additionally, the home button now includes a capacitive fingerprint sensor, which I'll discuss in more detail later on. Around back you'll find the small speaker grille, but the biggest change can be found farther up: Samsung installed a heart rate monitor next to the LED flash, just underneath the rear camera.As ever, Samsung included a removable back cover and a swappable battery, with a capacity of 2,800mAh (up from 2,600mAh). There's also a microSD slot for up to 128GB of external storage. Out of the box, you get either 16GB or 32GB of built-in storage; just remember that the operating system takes up a lot of space before you even get around to installing apps or downloading movies. In fact, my 16GB unit had a little under 12GB of space when I started using it, so if you're even slightly concerned about storing large files, I recommend going with the 32GB model or buying a big memory card to compensate.I won't spend a lot of time on connectivity because it will ultimately vary depending on where you live and which carrier you use (that last bit is particularly true in the US). That said, most variants feature quad-band GSM/EDGE, quad-band HSPA+ 42.2 Mbps (850/900/1900/2100) and LTE Cat 4 (which offers speeds of up to 150 Mbps). The GS5 also supports carrier aggregation, which basically means that it can fuse together LTE from different towers to increase your data speeds. But again, this will largely depend on whether your carrier even supports that technology.Finally, you'll also get Bluetooth 4.0 + LE, GPS/GLONASS, DLNA, USB OTG, MHL 2.0 and WiFi Direct. There's also dual-band WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, but the GS5 is the first phone that we've seen with two-channel MIMO support. In English, it includes an extra antenna, with which you could theoretically double your speed -- provided you have the right kind of supporting equipment, of course.Oh, and while I'm on the subject of speed, most versions of the GS5 come with a new feature called Download Booster, which essentially combines the power of LTE, WiFi and Grayskull to help large files download faster than they would on any one connection. The service won't work on anything smaller than 30MB, and doesn't apply to certain protocols like FTP and UDP. But if you're trying to install an app, load a YouTube video or save a movie your cousin shared with you on Facebook, Download Booster should do the trick. If you don't have an unlimited data plan, however, be very careful about how often you use this -- if you're not keeping tabs on your usage, your next bill might give you an aneurysm.DisplayThe S5's 5.1-inch Full HD Super AMOLED display has the same resolution as last year's flagship despite the larger size screen. Yes, pixel-density snobs, that means you're subjected to nine fewer pixels per inch (441 vs. 432). In any case, those nine pixels were worth the sacrifice: The display here is a surprising improvement over the S4. The difference is easy enough to see with the naked eye, especially when you put the two devices side by side.For starters, the S5 is much brighter than the S4, not only indoors, but also in direct sunlight (with auto-brightness turned on, the display goes up to around 450 nits). At the same time, it's also capable of dimming down to as low as two nits in pitch-black rooms. This makes for a more comfortable viewing experience when you're reading in a dark bedroom or (tsk, tsk) catching up on Facebook during a movie. The viewing angles have improved significantly as well: Even from a severe angle, the colors are more lifelike, and it's easier to read onscreen text. Admittedly, the HTC One M8's S-LCD panel does a better job with whites and darks, although the GS5 offers more color saturation (and it's not even over-the-top saturation this time, either). As you can see, I'm being rather nitpicky here, but I believe most users will be happy with either display.And if you're not happy? Unlike most non-Samsung phones (save for Nokia), the GS5 has five screen modes: Professional Photo, Cinema, Dynamic, Adapt and Standard. They all use a different color gamut; so if one doesn't fit your fancy, try the others to see what works best.Fingerprint scannerUntil the iPhone 5s came out, the last flagship phone with a fingerprint scanner was the Motorola Atrix 4G -- and that was three years ago. Back then, it was clear the technology wasn't ready for prime time, mostly because the sensors didn't actually work very well. Now, in 2014, the S5 comes with a capacitive fingerprint scanner built into the home button -- yep, just like on the iPhone. It remains to be seen if this leads to another court battle, but regardless, you can't fault Samsung for choosing the home button: We touch that part of the phone dozens (if not hundreds) times a day.So, how exactly does the scanner work here? Samsung's setup features Synaptics' Natural ID, which consists of a tiny sensor that sits underneath the button. (Synaptics calls it "a miniature touchpad with built-in capacitive sensing.") When it's time for the phone to learn your prints, you swipe your finger over the home button several times, allowing the sensor to read the inner live layers of the tip of your finger. Using signal strength, the sensor can draw a "map" of your fingerprint and presto -- you're all set. You can store up to three prints total, although I'd prefer even more.If the sensor doesn't recognize your finger after five attempts, the phone will prompt you to enter an alternative password. It's an alphanumeric password, mind, so you'll have to include both numbers and letters instead of a simple four-digit PIN code. On one hand (no pun intended), Samsung likely did it this way to make the phone more secure, but I still believe users should be able to choose what type of password they want.Speaking of security, should we be concerned about privacy? According to Samsung and Synaptics, the answer is no. When the sensor talks to the processor ("Hey, this print checks out just fine. Go ahead and let them in."), all information is encrypted. What's more, the prints are stored locally on the phone, and instead of storing an actual image of your print, it only logs a virtual map. Spoofing also wouldn't work; Synaptics says that any change in the physical properties of the phone will result in rejection.All in all, Samsung makes more use out of its fingerprint scanner than Apple does with Touch ID. Both the GS5 and iPhone 5s use the scanner to unlock the phone, obviously, but that's where the similarities end. The only other thing Touch ID can do is approve App Store and iTunes downloads. Samsung, meanwhile, lets you make online payments through PayPal, as well as access a private "locker" for confidential files. I'd also like to see these companies open up their sensors to third-party developers; all in due time, hopefully.Getting down to brass tacks, how well does the thing actually work? It depends. I trained the GS5 to recognize both of my thumbs and my right index finger, since those are the three digits I use the most when waking up the phone. Over the course of several days, I made dozens of attempts with each finger and it only recognized me on the first try about half the time -- and that's a generous estimate. More often than not, I had to swipe my finger two or three times before it let me in; typing in a PIN code would've been more efficient. Worse, there were other times when the scanner wouldn't recognize me at all, even as I adjusted my swipe speed, angle and finger pressure. And even when it works, there's a small delay after you swipe before the phone accepts your print.As for one-handed use, don't even bother. It's technically possible, but the odds of success are so low I have a better chance of seeing Narnia each time I open my closet. Normally, I hold the phone in my left hand and try to swipe the sensor with my left thumb; however, my thumb is at such an angle that the sensor simply can't recognize it. Sometimes it'll work if I push the phone up a little higher and try to position the thumb at a more shallow angle, but even then, it takes multiple attempts, and it's so off-balance that I've come close to dropping the device several times. Apple's sensor, on the other hand, has no problem picking up my fingerprint from any angle.To be fair, my experience may get better over time (although in Apple's case, it got worse for a while). It's obvious there's a learning curve here; it can take practice to place your finger in just the right place, at just the right speed with just the right amount of pressure. However, I don't believe most people will be that patient -- after a few frustrating attempts, users might simply turn the feature off (or worse, attempt a warranty swap because they think it's defective).There's a bit of a silver lining, at least: If you don't like it, don't want to use it or it simply doesn't work for you (or all of the above), you don't have to use it. And unlike the HTC One Max, whose fingerprint scanner sits below the rear camera, the sensor itself isn't visually distracting.Heart rate monitorSamsung's been making a big deal about health recently. It's offered an app called S Health for quite some time, which helps users track their exercise and food intake. Starting with the GS4 in particular, the app's been able to monitor heart rate and steps with the help of third-party accessories. Now, though, both of these features are built directly into the GS5, giving you one or two fewer fitness gadgets to carry around. That said, the heart rate monitors built into the new Gear 2 and Gear Fit smartwatches integrate with S Health, so the company's hoping you'll buy some fitness wearables after all (so long as they're made by Samsung, of course).To get started, go to the Heart Rate section of S Health. Then, once prompted, put your finger over the sensor, keep still and stay quiet. Be careful where you put your finger, though: The sensor, which uses a light that allows it to "see" and measure your pulse, is positioned almost directly beneath the camera lens. Without your eyes directly guiding your finger to the right place, it's easy to mistake the camera lens for the heart rate monitor. (Pro tip: You'll want to keep a cloth handy to wipe off the lens if you do this a lot.) As with the fingerprint scanner, positioning is crucial. If my finger was even slightly off, the monitor couldn't measure my pulse and I'd have to redo it. When you've done it right, you'll know pretty quickly since it only takes five seconds or so to complete the process.Our team tested the heart rate monitor against more dedicated fitness devices like the Garmin chest strap (connected to a Vivofit) and the Adidas Smart watch. After a series of tests, we noticed that the GS5's results averaged about five or six beats per minute lower than the Garmin and Adidas. That said, the scores did match sometimes, but this was the exception rather than the rule. In other words, the GS5 sensor will do a good job getting you an "in the neighborhood" reading, but you're still better off with a standalone monitor if you want the most precise results.SoftwareAs with the hardware design, Samsung's TouchWiz software tends to err on the safe side; in the past, Samsung only made minor tweaks to the UI. With the GS5, however, the company's Android skin has received quite the face-lift, resulting in a design that's flatter, more modern-looking. If you ask us, it's a step in the right direction -- and a sign that Samsung knows it needs to freshen up TouchWiz. Even so, the layout is confusing. The old TouchWiz used tabs on nearly every screen, but no longer. Meanwhile, Samsung introduced a new font, and for whatever reason, the interface uses a lot of circles. Oddly, too, there are some inconsistencies; the settings menu uses large, circular icons (though you can switch to list or tab view at any time), which makes it more of a chore to scroll through the menu. Icons in the main app drawer, on the other hand, hew to the old-school TouchWiz look. And that's not all: There are elements of stock Android (4.4.2 KitKat) sprinkled in as well.Most core apps have been redesigned to be more visually appealing, and even the recent apps menu has a fresh look. But given that Google recently had a discussion with Samsung about how it can down its Android skin, it's frustrating that there are at least two versions of most core apps -- Samsung pushes its own in-house software, even though Google provides similar apps of its own. This means there are two app stores, two music players, two browsers, two photo gallery apps, two voice assistants and three messaging apps (four on the AT&T version). While there's something to be said about choice, this is just a tangled mess, and I have to wonder if the extra baggage bogs down the phone's performance. Fortunately, you can hide the apps you don't plan to use, which at least cuts down on the clutter.My Magazine has carried over from the Note 3, but it's now accessible by swiping from left to right. If Samsung is indeed interested in getting on Google's good side, I'd like to see the company give us the choice between My Magazine and the Google Now experience. Curiously, it's not even part of the TouchWiz launcher, but, rather, a separate application. As for the feature itself, it's basically Flipboard with a few customizations -- in fact, clicking on categories and links will often take you out of My Magazine and into the actual Flipboard app.Older Samsung features like Air browse, Air view, Smart stay, Smart scroll and Smart rotation are all still here, though they aren't quite as in-your-face as they once were. In fact, most of them are buried in the settings, so you have to want them in order to find them. Safety Assistance, Blocking Mode and Easy Mode are also around.In the settings menu, you'll find a small, but important addition: a search function. If you know what you're looking for, but don't feel like spending an hour swiping through 20 menus to find it, you can search for the term and head straight there. Heck, if you're searching for a checkbox, the search results will include that box in the list, so you don't even have to go into the menu to toggle it.Like the HTC One M8, the GS5 features an extreme power-saving mode (Samsung calls it, "Ultra power saving mode"), which promises to conserve power when you find yourself getting dangerously low and need to stay afloat in case a call comes in. When you turn this feature on, it changes the launcher to a simple grayscale theme, caps your display brightness and restricts most apps from working, reserving your battery for only the tasks you'd need in an emergency. Mileage will vary, but even at 10 percent, you should be able to eke out nearly a full day of battery life.One last thing worth mentioning: the built-in "baby crying detector," which can be used with a Gear Watch. Put your phone within a meter of your little one and anytime they have a fit, your watch will vibrate. Of course, Samsung's quick to point out that this isn't intended to replace your babysitter, so if you're thinking of sneaking out for a spell, don't.CameraSamsung has a history of making smartphones with good cameras, but that doesn't mean it can rest on its laurels. The competition is getting fiercer: Nokia, Sony and even Chinese outfits like Oppo are doing some fantastic things with imaging. And so must Samsung. With the GS5, the company added a 16MP rear camera, some clever new editing tricks and a new "ISOCELL" technology that improves sharpness, low-light performance and color accuracy. (In case you're wondering, the front-facing camera is still capped at 2MP.)Just like the One M8, the GS5's top resolution uses a 16:9 aspect ratio for widescreen images, rather than the traditional 4:3. Fun fact: If you don't like going widescreen, the highest res you can get is 12MP, which is actually a lower resolution than the GS4's 13MP 4:3 camera. Obviously, pixel count isn't everything, and there are other aspects of the imaging experience to consider, but I still found this a tad disappointing.Resolution is likely the least interesting imaging spec on the camera, so let's take a quick look at the other stuff. The GS5 has the same f/2.2 aperture as its predecessor, as well as a focal length of 4.8mm (up from 4.24mm on the GS4). The 1/2.6-inch sensor is larger, but utilizes the same pixel size of 1.12 microns. Fortunately, ISOCELL addresses the concern with having such small pixels, and we'll cover that shortly.The new camera settings, meanwhile, are easier to navigate now that they're accessible from the viewfinder and can all be found in one place. While this may be confusing to some, I prefer it this way over the GS4, which has multiple levels of menus. Unless you knew exactly where to go, it was difficult to find what you were looking for. Fortunately, there's space on the sidebar for up to three custom shortcuts, so you can drag over the settings you'll be adjusting the most.The camera modes have also been streamlined here. Quite a few are no longer listed by default, but if you press the "download" option, you'll be taken into the Samsung Store, where you can find all of them. What's more, Eraser, Drama and Best photo modes have merged into one mode known as "Shot & More." This is a lot like what Nokia has done with its Smart Camera. While it makes more sense to combine them into one mode, there's still a lingering problem: I don't always know that I need Eraser until after I've already taken my shot. As an example, I usually don't know that a photobomber is going to step into my shot until I'm actually taking the picture; switching to Shot & More mode means I have to know there's a good chance that some random dude is going to try to become part of my family portrait. Lastly, the default auto mode is now smart enough to detect when it's nighttime, so it can adjust to that particular setting automatically. (That said, you can turn on the photo stabilizer effect to get even more light, if auto doesn't work well enough.)The HTC One M8 has UFocus; now Samsung is introducing something called Selective Focus. As with UFocus, you can blur out the background or a target in the foreground. The catch: You have to be within 1.5 feet of whatever object is in the foreground. Even then, there were many times when I couldn't get it to work. Small objects, large objects -- it didn't matter. The feature is temperamental, it seems, but at least it saves the image as a regular photo if you don't succeed. Even when it does work, it's not perfect. In the image above, I took a picture focused on the red sundial and when I shifted the focus to the buildings in the background, not everything in the foreground actually blurred out, as you can see below.I was particularly impressed by the GS5's real-time HDR feature. Normally, I have to chance it with HDR images because I don't get to see how it will turn out ahead of time. The GS5's processor is powerful enough, however, that it's now possible to see what the image will actually look like before taking it, which increases my likelihood of taking a good photo. This feature is also available in the One M8.Samsung also says the camera is capable of focusing on targets in 300ms (0.3 second), making it just as fast as the M8. This is made possible through phase detection (PDAF). Unlike most smartphone cameras, which determine focus through contrast, PDAF divvies up incoming light into a pair of photos and then compares the two. If you don't have enough light coming in, the camera will shift back to the traditional contrast autofocus method. I couldn't see a noticeable difference in focus lock times between the GS5 and the M8 (same goes with default shutter speed). Either way, both were quicker than the GS4.The GS5 also lets you manually tweak the settings to your liking, but it doesn't offer quite as many options (or as good a UI) as the new HTC One. It's not much different from other Galaxy phones, either: You can set white balance, metering method, exposure and ISO (up to 800). Still, HTC adds extras like shutter speed and focus type, along with sliders and the ability to save presets, so you can easily switch back and forth between modes instead of having to change each setting every time.The GS5 may not have an extra camera to add depth information, but it brings plenty of great editing features that make you feel as if you're enjoying Photoshop on your phone. You can still rotate, crop and resize; add stickers, frames and drawings; throw in portrait effects; and adjust color saturation, contrast and temperature. What's different this time is the ability to select a specific part of your photo and tweak just that part while leaving the rest of the picture untouched. In other words, if one part of your image is blown out, you can select that area and tweak the settings to tone it down. In case you don't really know how you want to adjust the shot, there's also an auto-enhance feature that might give you a nudge in the right direction.The size of each pixel on the GS5's main camera remains the same as on the GS4, so does Samsung do anything else to improve low-light performance? It does, in the form of its new ISOCELL technology, which first debuted last fall. The explanation of how it all works is pretty technical and I'll let the video above do most of the explaining. In short, ISOCELL adds tiny barriers between individual pixels, which increases image sharpness, color accuracy and light sensitivity -- all aspects that come as disadvantages for most BSI sensors. The new tech also allows the lens to be closer to the sensor, which makes it so the camera module can be smaller.All told, ISOCELL improves Samsung's imaging quality, but the results aren't quite as good when compared to the One M8, Lumia 1020 and iPhone 5s. I'm not saying nighttime images on the GS5 are horrid -- they're still perfectly usable in most cases -- but the performance just isn't up to par with other devices that have popped up on the market in the past year. Simply put, most night shots appear darker and noisier.Fortunately the GS5 holds up well in good lighting conditions. My pictures were slightly more detailed than they were on the GS4 and One M8. I didn't have to make any adjustments to the settings in direct sunlight, whereas the M8 tends to take blown-out shots if I don't dial back the exposure a notch or two. Image quality was also on par with the iPhone 5s, with only slight variations in color saturation.(Note: I've uploaded a gallery of full-res photos here.)Performance and battery lifeIn the year since the GS4 came out, we've seen two new generations of high-end Snapdragon chipsets: the 800 last fall, followed by the 801, which is what Samsung used on the GS5. As is too often the case, it won't be long before the muscle behind Samsung's state-of-the-art model is no longer the best available, as the Snapdragon 805 will land in a few months, with the 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 810 landing this time next year. Heck, maybe that's what we can expect in the GS6!With a quad-core 2.5GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and a 578MHz Adreno 330 GPU, the GS5 is predictably powerful. Even so, I can't shake the feeling that something in the bowels of TouchWiz is preventing it from reaching its full potential. Despite having a faster clock speed than the One M8 (both phones use a Snapdragon 801, but the M8's version has a lower max speed at 2.3GHz), most transitions seem to take longer to complete and apps load slightly slower than they do on the One.Again, it may feel like I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but this slight lag also translates into some odd happenings on the graphics side. My game tests of choice were Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2, since both need some serious horsepower to run smoothly. Most of my gameplay unfolded without incident, but the titles slowed down and even froze up more often than they should have, considering the powerful chipset being used.The S5's battery held up well during my week of use, and it's a slight improvement over the GS4. Still, the HTC One M8 is even better. With heavy usage, I tended to get concerned near the end of the day that the 2,800mAh battery wasn't going to make it. Thankfully, though, it never completely gave up on me. In other words, the battery got me through a full day, but more often than not, it came a little too close to empty. In our formal rundown test, meanwhile, the battery kept going through nearly 10 hours of video playback. That's not as impressive as the M8, which lasted 11 and a half hours, but it's still better than the GS4, which gave out after nine hours and 15 minutes. With more moderate use, you should last into a second day; naturally, mileage will vary depending on what you're doing with your phone and how strong your signal is.Audio on the GS5's speakers isn't quite as loud or clear as BoomSound on the One M8. Worse, the sound rattled the back of the phone anytime I cranked up the volume. In fact, the louder the music got, the more muffled and blown-out the sound became. Plugging in a pair of headphones helped me to sidestep the problem, at least. Likewise, call quality on both my unlocked handset and my AT&T version sounded clear with no complaints on either end of the line. Bluetooth connectivity worked flawlessly, even with several devices connected at the same time, and NFC performed as well as I'd hoped. GPS navigation didn't have any noticeable issues, either.Wrap-upChances are, you'll be happy with the Galaxy S5 if you choose to buy it. It's a solid upgrade to the Galaxy S4, with reasonable improvements to the design, software and camera. I can't say this is your most visually appealing option, especially compared to the all-metal HTC One M8, but the dimpled back and waterproof casing at least add more durability than we've enjoyed on previous Galaxy S devices.The fingerprint scanner and the heart rate monitor, on the other hand, need some work. Each delivers inconsistent results and can be quite frustrating to use. The good news is that you don't have to use them if you have the same experience that I did; the bad news is: If you don't take advantage of these features, you have fewer reasons to buy the phone in the first place. What's more, Samsung put a lot of energy into integrating these features into both the GS5's hardware and software, which makes me wonder what the company could have included instead if it left those out. If you're looking for a good Android phone, the GS5 won't let you down. I'd be happy using this as my daily driver. That said, I wouldn't waste an early upgrade on it, either.Samsung Galaxy Alpha, S5 Active now in Canada (with video)I brought Samsung�s new Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy S5 Active smartphones home and put them out on a table to show my daughter.She picked up Samsung Alpha, barely glancing at the S5 Active, the ruggedized version of the S5.Flipping it around in her hand, she had hardly turned it on when she announced: �This is the one I�d want.�Samsung Galaxy Alpha (left) and Galaxy S5 ActiveAnd that was probably Samsung�s intent in delivering its most elegant phone yet, a metal-framed device that, at 4.7-inches has the same screen size as Apple�s new iPhone 6 and is considerably smaller than the Galaxy S5, which has a  5.1-inch display. With its best design to date, Samsung is no doubt hoping  to appeal to users who are drawn to form before function.There�s a market for a range of phones and in this case, the Galaxy Alpha appeared to be the one that would convince my daughter, a university undergrad, to make the shift from Apple to Alpha. And that after she has used an iPhone since the first one was released in Canada.In an interview, Samsung�s Ken Price said that�s what it�s all about � delivering choice for the consumer.�Samsung is all about choice and variety for our users and so we have a couple of choices for people to makes as they go into the holiday season,� he said.Interestingly his teen daughter also prefers the Alpha. Parents of course � if they�re still paying for their kids� phones � would probably rather they carry the rugged phone.I�m trying out both the Alpha and the Active and for my active west coast lifestyle, the S5 Active is the answer � delivering all the features of the S5 but in a ruggedized form that will take more of the mishaps of daily life without having to be safeguarded inside an expensive case. I like the feel of the Alpha, both in my hand and in my pocket, but I�d choose the Active because the Alpha is missing some features that I particularly like in the larger phone. And that�s not just screen size � I�d give up some screen real estate for a phone that would easier to carry around.While the S5 has more features than the Alpha, the latter has the look and feel of a premium phone.Samsung Galaxy AlphaThe Alpha is wrapped in a polished aluminum frame, answering a call by critics and fans alike for a phone that�s more than plastic.However, it still has the plastic back, similar to the S5 but with a useful feature common to all Samsung phones � the back can be removed to change the battery, to add the microSIM (with the Alpha,  a nano SIM) � and in the case of the S5 to expand storage with an microSD card. The Alpha, which comes only in a 32GB version, doesn�t offer the extra storage option, which is too bad. I consider extra storage an important plus and it�s a feature not offered by Apple. Also missing is the IR blaster for controlling your TV.The Alpha is a skinny 6.7 mm and weighs only 115 grams, making it slightly lighter and thinner than the iPhone 6. At 142mm the S5 is 10 mm taller than the Alpha, its width is 72 mm compared to the Alpha�s 65 mm and the S5 is more than a millimetre thicker at 7.9 mm.The 1280 x 720 resolution screen would seem a noticeable step down from the 1920 x 1080 full HD of the S5, but looking at the two phones side-by-side it�s not something that would be enough to make you choose one over the other. The S5 has a whopping 432 ppi, (pixels per inch), which seems a lot compared to the 312 ppi of the Alpha. However, the iPhone 6 is 326 PPI, so that�s probably the better comparison.The Alpha has the same fingerprint sensor as the S5 and it has the heart monitor, a feature that takes advantage of Samsung�s S Health app.The Alpha isn�t waterproof, disappointing since the S5 is and for the outdoors type � like my ski buddies who pull out their phones wrapped, case and all, in plastic baggies � that�s an important consideration.Both the S5 and the new Alpha have UHD 4K video at 30 frames per second, although the main camera on the Alpha is 12 megapixels, compared to 16MP for the S5.The S5 and the S5 Active are pretty much the same phone under the cover, except that the Active doesn�t have a fingerprint scanner. Instead it has three physical buttons across the bottom on the front of the phone � likely part of the rugged package. The phones share the same dust and water resistance rating � the S5 and the S5 Active are water resistant up to one metre and for 30 minutes.It has an active button on the lefthand side that pressed launches the Activity Zone, which includes apps like a barometer, compass, flashlight, stopwatch and other shortcuts. Pressed down and held, it activates the camera.At $150 with a two-year contract for the Alpha or $700 with no contract, despite having fewer features, its price tag is close to the Galaxy S5, which is $200 with a two-year contract. And for the unlocked version, the price is the same $700.The iPhone 6 starts $265 with a two-year term for the 16GB version and is $750 unlocked. If Samsung�s trying to attract potential iPhone buyers with the Alpha, maybe it�s comparing the price to the iPhone 6. However, the Alpha isn�t Samsung flagship phone, it just has the flagship price.The S5 Active is somewhat pricier than the S5, at $250 with a two-year term and $750 with no contract.The best news for consumers in the smartphone wars is that the choice is growing.Samsung Galaxy S5 Hits 10 Million Sales Mark: Smartphone Beats Galaxy S4 Initial Sales Record By Two DaysThe Samsung Galaxy S5 has entered the market on a strong point as reports out of Korea indicate the smartphone has shipped more than 10 million units in 25 days.At this point, the Galaxy S5 can be considered Samsung�s bestselling smartphone to date, beating out its predecessor the Samsung Galaxy S4, which shipped 10 million units in 27 days. Notably, these figures are not indicative of how many consumers have purchased the Galaxy S5 but rather how many handsets have been shipped to for sale. However, it can be deduced that the amount of Galaxy S5 units that have shipped is correlated with demand for the device.According to reports in early April, the Samsung Galaxy S5 sold better on its launch day than the Galaxy S4 at several retailers. Samsung Experience stores in the U.K. saw long lines of customers anxious to get their hands on the 2014 flagship. In Paris, the Samsung Experience store sold its entire 800-unit inventory. Additionally, some mobile networks in South Korea released the Galaxy S5 prior to the April 11 global launch date, and reported impressive sales. According to Yonhap News, carrier SK Telecom garnered average daily sales of 7,000 units in its first week of selling the Galaxy S5, which it made available to customers on March 27.Each Samsung Galaxy device has sold better than its predecessor. Before the Galaxy S4, the Samsung Galaxy S3 shipped 10 million units in 50 days, while it took the Samsung Galaxy S2 five months and the original Samsung Galaxy S seven months to move that much inventory.As sales go on, the Galaxy S5 probably will continue be compared to previous Galaxy devices. After its strong release, the Galaxy S4 went on to sell 20 million handsets in two months, 30 million handsets in four months and 40 million handsets in five months. The Galaxy S3 has sold approximately 60 million handsets since its 2012 release.Since these are only preliminary sales figures for the Samsung Galaxy S5 there is no definitive proof that the Galaxy S5 has already outsold the Galaxy S4. According to the Chitika online advertising network, the Samsung Galaxy S5 accounted for 4.3 percent of all North American smartphone traffic in the 25 days since the device�s release. In comparison, the Galaxy S4 accounted for 2 percent of North American smartphone traffic in the same time.BGR notes that these figures indicate that more Galaxy S5 handsets have been online in the past 25 days, not that more Galaxy S5 handsets were purchased. Galaxy S5 sales figures will have to be studied over the coming months to determine the true impact of the device.Samsung: Galaxy S5 sales stronger than Galaxy S4In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Samsung�s co-chief executive and head of the mobile business J.K. Shin confirmed what some reports already revealed � that the Galaxy S5 has been selling very well in the first month � and provided a sales number for the phone�s first month.Shin said that Samsung managed to sell 11 million Galaxy S5 units in the first month, beating the Galaxy S4 first month sales by 1 million units.�It�s been a month since we began selling the S5, and out of the gate, sales are much stronger than the Galaxy S4,� Shin said, adding that sales are particularly good in developed markets including the U.S., Australia and Germany.Shin explained that the better Galaxy S5 performance is due to �better preparations than in previous years,� including a wider roll out, major carrier agreements and expanded presence in stores such as Best Buy.Interestingly, Shin said that when designing the Galaxy S5, Samsung took into account input received from after-service centers. Apparently 30% of the phones brought to its service centers were turned in �because people were spilling coffee over them or dropping them in water.�Shin also sort of acknowledged that the phone could be better, but defended the product, which received some criticism following its launch. �It may not have eye-popping technology but the features are practical,� said Mr. Shin.Samsung also said that in the coming months, variations of the Galaxy S5 will be released in various countries without revealing their product names. The company is expected to soon launch a Galaxy S5 Prime and a Galaxy S5 Active.Samsung Galaxy S5 said not selling as well as S4Samsung reportedly sells 40 percent fewer Galaxy S5 phones than expected during its first three months on sale, prompting a change in mobile strategy and possible management shake-up.Samsung's Galaxy S5 might be one of the most advanced smartphones the company has launched, but it's reportedly not selling as well as the company hoped.In the first three months since its April release, Samsung sold 40 percent fewer of the big-screen Galaxy S5 smartphones -- designed to take on Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus -- than expected, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. In total, Samsung sold 12 million Galaxy S5 units during the three-month period, compared to 16 million Galaxy S4 units during the same period, the report claims, citing people who claim to have knowledge of Samsung's plans.For its part, Samsung has not disclosed actual Galaxy S5 sales, but the company reported a 74 percent year-over-year drop in profit in its mobile business during its last fiscal quarter. It also warned that conditions would remain tough in smartphones as competition heats up toward the end of the year.The Journal suggests the company could be shaking up its corporate structure. Samsung is contemplating removing J.K. Shin, the company's current mobile chief, from his post and replacing him with B.K. Yoon, who currently serves as chief executive of the company's home appliances and television operations, the Journal reported. It's not clear when a decision might be made on the matter.Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday on the Journal's story.Samsung launched the Galaxy S5 to much fanfare in April. The device was viewed as an evolutionary upgrade to the Galaxy S4, featuring a textured backplate and improved resistance to dust and water. CNET senior editor Jessica Dolcourt gave the handset a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that while it was "subtly improved and smartly refined," the Galaxy S5 was overall "a superior smartphone that hits every mark but the sharpest design."However, the company's mobile troubles have been well-documented over the last several months as it has been forced to acknowledge that increased competition internationally -- especially in China -- and growing concern over its margins have caused it to rethink its mobile strategy. Samsung is planning to reduce the number of devices it sells and maintain more of its focus on those that are particularly popular.Despite the Galaxy S5's troubles, it actually sold better than the S4 in the US, according to the Journal. In China, arguably one of the most important mobile markets worldwide with the growing consumer market, sales were down 50 percent compared to the Galaxy S4.Samsung profits decline as other OEMs eat its lunchSales numbers always show gains for Android as a whole quarter after quarter. The little green robot continues to be unstoppable, and in the past few years that has largely been thanks to Samsung�s domination of the Android device ecosystem. It ruled the high-end with the Galaxy S series and cleaned up at the low end with devices like the Galaxy Ace. The newest numbers show Android still on the rise, but Samsung is faltering as it deals with attacks from both ends of the market. The Korean OEM might have to change to stay on top.Samsung is reporting its lowest profits in more than two years, which must be concerning to a company used to big growth. So what�s causing Samsung�s woes? Perhaps the most obvious issue is that high-end smartphones are peaking � the market is simply becoming saturated with people who already have smartphones, and most of them aren�t going to spend $700 to get the new Galaxy S every year. No, they�ll just wait until their contract is up for renewal, thank you very much.It�s not just saturation, though. Samsung is also experiencing competition from top-tier OEMs like it has never seen before. Samsung�s hometown rival LG used to be almost irrelevant in the smartphone market, but phones like the Nexus 5 and G3 have catapulted LG into the spotlight. It�s very much a darling of the Android world among western consumers right now. For HTC�s problems, it�s finally seeing some growth, and the M8 is a beautiful premium device. The Galaxy S5 is a very good phone, but it�s not objectively better than the other flagship devices right now. Add to that Samsung�s continued build quality issues and you have a recipe for trouble.Perhaps even more vexing for Samsung is the trend in low-cost devices. It�s the flagship devices that get all the attention, but most Android phones are mid-range and low-end devices, many of which are sold in developing markets. Samsung used to dominate here as well, but Chinese OEMs are finding more success at home and abroad. Huawei actually doubled its phone shipments year-over-year, and Lenovo saw big increases in China too. These companies work to deeply integrate services that Chinese consumers can use in a market where Google�s services are unreliable or inaccessible � Samsung isn�t in a position to do that.The pending acquisition of Motorola by Lenovo is also bad news for Samsung. It gives Lenovo a well-known brand outside of China and access to a lot of technology. The Moto G and Moto E have sold very well in developing markets around the world, and future devices based on that model could move even more units with Lenovo at the helm.While Samsung is staying outwardly aloof, I wouldn�t be surprised if there was a moderate amount of panic inside the company. There are already signs that the OEM is looking to pivot and regain some momentum. The first Tizen smartphone has been postponed indefinitely and the company plans to release an Android phone this year that isn�t made out of plastic, which should help its products feel a bit more premium.There are rumors of a �Galaxy Alpha� device launching in the next few months. This phone would be a metallic remix of the current Galaxy S5, possibly including a few spec bumps. However, the real test of Samsung�s will to change its fortunes will the the launch of the Galaxy Note 4 later this year. If it�s just another plastic Samsung phone with the same ol� design, other OEMs might continue to gobble up market share. This could be good for us, though. Competition means more innovation and compelling products.Samsung's phone market share takes a bruising as Chinese rivals surgeSamsung warned that its smartphone sales weren't that great this spring, and now we have the numbers to show just what the company meant. IDC estimates that Samsung's smartphone shipments saw a rare year-over-year drop in the second quarter, taking it from a lofty 32.3 percent market share down to 25.2 percent. That's still enough to give it a comfortable lead, but a shock for a company which is used to growth. The cause, analysts say, is the rapid rise of Chinese brands that cut directly into Samsung's low-end business. Huawei claimed 6.9 percent of the smartphone space after doubling its shipments, thanks in part to heavy discounts on phones like the Ascend P7; Lenovo jumped to 5.4 percent on the back of both budget phones at home as well as rapid expansion abroad.Both Apple (11.9 percent) and LG (4.9 percent) lost share, although IDC notes that their shipments were up. Also, neither firm was expected to have a stellar season. LG only just launched its hot-selling G3 flagship at the tail end of the spring, while many expect Apple to jumpstart sales with at least one new iPhone in September. It may be trickier for Samsung to bounce back, however. The spring was supposed to represent a big spike in sales as the Galaxy S5 arrived, but that didn't materialize. The company is pinning its hopes on both a new Galaxy Note and a mountain of budget phones. However, historically, neither has sold as well as the Galaxy S series.Top job shake up possible at Samsung after Galaxy S5 sales disappointSamsung may not have the hold over the Android smartphone world it once did. A report in the Wall Street Journal states the company has sold 40 percent fewer Galaxy S5 smartphones than the previous Galaxy S4 model. Current CEO JK Shin had high hopes for the S5, and ordered 20 percent more models to be produced than the S4, many of which are filling warehouses due to lower than expected sales.Launched at Mobile World Congress back in February, we noted the Galaxy S5 didn�t break new ground, but did come with a selection of desirable features, including a water resistant body and a much improved user interface. However, it was soon trumped by the high-tech LG G3, and the all-metal HTC One M8.Related: Read our review of the Galaxy S5 herePoor S5 sales aren�t a surprise. Samsung spent much of 2013 boasting about Galaxy S4 sales, which reached a record-breaking 40 million after six months, but the firm has stayed quiet about the S5 since May. At the time, Shin said S5 sales were stronger than the S4. The Journal�s report didn�t mention sales figures, but did state the U.S. was the one international market where the S5 has outsold the S4. However, sales in China are apparently half of previous Galaxy S phones.Management to answer for poor salesThe Galaxy S5�s lackluster performance may prompt a management reshuffle, and if the WSJ�s sources are correct, CEO JK Shin could be replaced by Boo-Keun Yoon who currently leads Samsung�s home and television divisions. This hasn�t been confirmed by Samsung. The news comes after reports the company will produce fewer smartphone models next year, and will look at cutting edge tech such as curved screens to make its expensive hardware more desirable. At the end of October, Samsung�s mobile division reported its lowest profit for three years, and at the time said �high-end smartphone sales� were primarily to blame.Local reports from Korea say Samsung will slowly close down its ChatOn mobile messaging platform, again due to falling profits. Unnamed officials told the Korea Herald Samsung would �exit from the mobile messaging market from region-to-region as part of corporate strategy to restructure unprofitable businesses.� ChatOn is available in more than 120 countries, and at its peak attracted 100 million users.Analysts predict strong end of year for AppleIn related news, analysts are predicting strong sales results from Apple at the end of the year. KGI�s Ming-Chi Kuo�s research shows Apple is on target to ship more than 71 million iPhone models over the final three months of the year, 56 million of which will be the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Interestingly, splitting that figure down further shows the iPhone 6 taking 41 million of those sales, leaving 15 million for the larger iPhone 6 Plus. Moving into next year, Kuo sees the initially high numbers falling to just over 31 million sales for the two new models combined, and slightly under 50 million overall.Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone fingerprint sensor hackedResearchers show 'spoofing' of fingerprint system, warning lack of 'lock-out' security makes flagship less safe than iPhone (updated)The fingerprint security on Samsung's flagship Galaxy S5 phone has been hacked by a German team, who warn that its implementation is less secure - and its consequences potentially much worse - than on Apple's iPhone 5S.Security Research Labs, based in Berlin, posted a YouTube clip (included below) showing how they had used a rubber mould incorporating a high-resolution image of a fingerprint lifted from a smartphone screen. The same print and mould that was used to spoof the iPhone 5S's fingerprint sensor was used to fool Samsung's.But the researchers pointed to what they said are "additional concerns" about Samsung's security system compared with the iPhone's, because a would-be hacker can make an unlimited number of attempts at spoofing the fingerprint, and because it can be linked to payment systems such as PayPal - which could then be used to wire money to the attacker's account."Samsung's implementation of fingerprint authentication leaves much to be desired," the researcher from SRE said. "They do not seem to have learned from what what others have done� while biometrics will always carry with them the trade of security for convenience, it is the manufactures responsibility to implement them in a way that does not put their users crucial data and payment accounts at risk."The group specifically highlights the absence of a "lock out" function compared with the iPhone 5S, the only other mass-market phone offering fingerprint authentication. Other manufacturers including HTC and Motorola have offered fingerprint unlocking, but with little takeup.Apple's implementation, called Touch ID, locks out the user after three attempts, if the phone has been turned off, if more than 48 hours have passed since the phone was unlocked, or to change or remove the Touch ID setting. Once locked out, the user has to enter a password or code to access the phone.Apple also only links its Touch ID system to unlocking the phone or its App Store, though once a phone is unlocked any app is accessible.But Samsung offers fingerprint authentication to unlock the phone, for Paypal payments, and to secure folders on the phone. "This gives a would-be attacked an even greater incentive to learn the simple skill of spoofing fingerprints," said SRE's researcher, pointing out that they could use the Paypal implementation to send large sums of money while using the fake fingerprint as verification.The threat to both Samsung and Apple users seems to be largely theoretical, however. It requires a high-quality fingerprint lifted from clean glass, and scanned at high resolution, and then printed on to latex rubber. Since the iPhone 5S went on sale in September 2013, there have been no recorded cases of where the fingerprint has been spoofed to hack into the phone beyond laboratory tests such as those by SRE.In a statement, Samsung said: "This is a scenario that is widely regarded in the industry as posing no critical risk for general consumers. This artificial experiment requires a rare combination of highly specialised equipment, materials and conditions. Samsung takes security matters very seriously. We are continuously taking measures to vigorously enhance the security of the device."Paypal said in a statement to Android Community that "While we take the findings from Security Research Labs very seriously, we are still confident that fingerprint authentication offers an easier and more secure way to pay on mobile devices than passwords or credit cards." The Paypal integration adds a cryptographic "key", not the actual password, it said: "We can simply deactivate the key from a lost or stolen device, and you can create a new one." In the event of fraud, the company said, "you are covered by our purchase protection policy."Samsung Galaxy S5 reviewThe next big thing is a lot of little things�It�s all in the little things.� It�s a common axiom in sports, in design, and in life. Inches make champions; big things have small beginnings; a small leak can sink a giant ship. It�s a tired clich�, but it�s true. It�s even true in smartphones. Apple�s greatest success isn�t the iPhone�s camera or its software or its battery life � it�s the scrolling and drawing animations, the obvious care put into even the smallest parts of the user experience. They�re things you might never even notice or name, but the small things add up to something important. Details matter.That�s never been Samsung�s strong suit. Samsung is big. It makes big phones with big screens with big ideas intended to push the boundaries of what a smartphone could or would or should ever do. But this year, Samsung�s trying something a little bit different. With the new Galaxy S5, the Korean company says it focused on the things that matter, not the gimmicky, overbearing features that have unfortunately become its calling card. It�s back to basics, back to what really makes a great smartphone.The result is on sale now, for $199 or $249 on virtually every major carrier. It�s a big phone made up of a lot of little things.A year ago, I wondered if HTC's gorgeous, metallic One would inspire or challenge Samsung to leave behind its cheap, plasticky ways and build a smartphone as beautiful as it is feature-rich. The Galaxy S5 is not that phone: it's every bit as utilitarian and function-first as its predecessors. It has a slightly larger display than last year's model, and the phone is thus slightly taller and wider, but it's still light (5.1 ounces) and thin (8.1 millimeters), and really feels no different than the S4 or any other phone this size."Samsung's phones are still commodities, made to be sold but not loved"It's plastic everywhere you touch. It comes in black, white, gold, or blue, each with a ribbed chrome edge that sticks slightly above the front face of the phone. It's Samsung's best use of plastic ever, with a soft, stippled back that doesn't collect grease or shine the way the S4 does. It's far more pleasant both to look at and hold than the S4, or even the fake-leather Note 3. Samsung is slowly learning how to make premium plastic, though it could stand to learn a lot more from Nokia and Apple on the subject.The real feat was taking that thin, light, plastic shell and somehow making it waterproof. The S5 is rated IP 67, which means it can be submerged in up to a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. You can't use it underwater, of course � the touchscreen goes haywire when it's wet � but it means you can spill coffee on your phone (which I did), get caught in a rainstorm (check), or drop your phone in the urinal (twice), and it'll live to see another day. I've had one phone ruined by rain and another by a random beer spill, so it's nice to let my paranoia go for a change.But the S5 is still creaky and cheap. It doesn�t feel thoughtfully crafted the way the One or the iPhone 5S does. The carrier and manufacturer logos aren't integrated into the back's dimpled design, just slapped on like rectangular stickers. The capacitive keys next to the phone's home button bleed an ugly circle of white light. Every time the phone vibrates, its back rattles. These are small things, but they betray the fact that Samsung believes a phone that works is good enough, that it needn't be something we love or care about. That leaves me cold, underwhelmed � I can't imagine anyone walking into a store, picking up the S5 and the new One, and not immediately feeling the difference.Even in hardware, Samsung touts capability rather than quality. One of the S5's flagship features is its fingerprint sensor, which lets you unlock your phone and even pay for things with one swipe of your finger. It does work, as long as you hold the phone in two hands and oh-so-carefully swipe your finger down the exact center of the home button, at the perfect angle and speed. If you get it wrong, it falls back on a pointlessly complex alphanumeric password. It's impossible to do in one hand, and I could type the world's longest, most secure password in less time than it typically took me to get the sensor to work. Next to Samsung's implementation, Apple's TouchID suddenly feels easy and consistent. (It's not.) I'll never actually use the S5�s fingerprint security, and I can't imagine anyone else will either."A great display makes everything better"Build quality may not matter to Samsung, but luckily display quality does, and it shows. The S5's 5.1-inch, 1080p AMOLED display is simply gorgeous. It's a little more intense and vibrant than the LCD screens I'm used to, but the effect is now much more subtle than on previous devices. The screen has near-perfect viewing angles, gorgeous color reproduction, and appears almost to be perched above the phone, games and movies leaping out toward me. Beautiful displays are non-negotiable in a great smartphone, and Samsung delivers.It's one of three things Samsung tells me it paid particular attention to this year. The second is battery life, and once again the Korean giant proves that it can do whatever it sets its mind to. The S5 never lasted me less than a full day (though I�m told connecting a Gear Fit can kill the battery fast), and unless I'm watching Netflix all day I can use the phone well into the next afternoon before I need to charge it again. Thanks to a fast quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM, the S5 is both powerful and long-lasting.The third thing, the last of the must-haves for the Galaxy S5, is the camera. And the S5's new 16-megapixel rear-facing camera is often very good: I took a lot of sharp, bright, detailed photos. (I also took too many of them at a 16:9 aspect ratio, different from every other camera ever made � take the megapixel hit and change that setting.) The camera has a tendency to slightly over-saturate colors, but rarely to anything more than a vaguely artistic effect. Samsung claims the S5's autofocus is faster than the S4�s, thanks to a second sensor that enables phase-detect focus, but it's still occasionally inconsistent and imperfect. It also touts a Lytro-like refocusing mode, but that almost never works and is hilariously basic when it does. The new Real Time HDR mode, on the other hand, is awesome: it makes it far easier to preview and shoot photos with a dark subject and bright background, and it saved a lot of shots for me."The GS5 can take very good pictures, but it doesn't always deliver"Low light's a problem, though. Where HTC opted to use fewer but larger pixels, which leads to brighter but softer images, Samsung picked sharpness and darkness. That makes photos better in good light, but in dark situations the phone has to rely on its software processing. A good low-light shot on the S5 is a bit soft; a bad one is an impressionist painting. I've never had particularly high hopes for low-light photography on my smartphone, though, and most of the shots I took were at least usable. And I'll take Samsung's sharp outdoor shots over HTC's mushy ones any day, though the iPhone 5S still offers a far better mix of sharpness and versatility than either one.The camera used to be the most obvious canvas for Samsung's impulsive feature creep, but it's been scaled back a lot this year. Sort of, anyway: there are still dozens of options and filters, plus "Beauty Face" and all the fun dual-camera modes, they're all just a little better hidden. The new "Shot and More" mode lumps them all into one, telling you after your shot which you can apply. That's not a shooting mode, though, that's an editing tool, and it doesn't really make sense in the S5�s workflow."There's still too much going on, it's just a little harder to find"Screenshot_2014-04-14-10-39-17This is a theme with the S5. Samsung says it refined its focus, but that's not really true: there are still too many features, too many options, too many weird ideas about how we want to use our phones. It's just all been tossed in a pile, thrown under a blanket, and swept into the corner where we hopefully won't notice. The S5's settings menu is 61 items long, and shows by default a grid of all-but-identical circular icons. Good luck with that.The notification pull-down menu has 20 different options, from Airplane Mode to Toolbox (which toggles a button that toggles a list of apps you might want to open, which is not to be confused with the multitasking view or the multi-window view or the app drawer). And for all the "simplification," there are still 27 options in the camera menu. Samsung's latest version of TouchWiz is layered on top of Android 4.4.2, and it's a lot more cohesive in appearance than before, but it's still little more than a junkyard full of 11 ways to do the same thing you�ll never ever want to do. Samsung says all the right things about cleaning up and simplifying the experience, but the S5 bears few of the fruits of those promises.The S5's built-in and pre-loaded apps are a similar mix: a number of useful, effective additions that are all too easily missed in the ocean of icons on the phone. S Health is in theory a good idea, a full-featured fitness app that lets you track everything from steps to calories. But it�s no more useful than, say, Fitbit, except that it integrates with Samsung's other devices like the Gear and Gear Fit, and with the heart-rate monitor that carves a divot out of the phone's backside. The monitor does work, but it's an odd feature to devote Samsung's time and attention to. The most fitness-conscious S5 buyers are likely to also buy a Gear Fit � which also has a heart-rate monitor � or a device like it, and Samsung would be better served by offloading these ancillary features onto companion devices. Most S5 buyers will never use the heart-rate monitor, so why make it such a central part of the device?Samsung Galaxy S57.8Verge ScoreGood StuffGreat displayExcellent performanceCamera can take amazing picturesWaterproofBad StuffOverwhelming features and optionsCheap, boring designCamera struggles in low light"Imagine what Samsung could do, if it tried"It's back to basics, Samsung says about the Galaxy S5. Time to focus on what matters � displays, batteries, and cameras � and to start to let the rest go. That's the approach Samsung needed to take, but all it was was lip service.Make no mistake: this is a very good phone. And Samsung did nearly all the important things well. With a great screen, great battery life, and a good camera, the S5 leaves me with few reasons not to recommend it � and the waterproof body is a fantastic bonus. But I don't love anything about this device. It's not beautiful like the One, not polished like the iPhone, not full of cool new software like the Moto X. The S5 is a very good phone, but it leaves me wanting more. I want Samsung to care about design, to believe that its customers have good taste and that there's more to building brand loyalty than beating customers over the head with clever commercials. I want it to give me something, anything, that's both truly different and truly great. But that's not what Samsung does.I like the Galaxy S5. I do. Millions of people will buy it, and very few will have problems with it. Yet I can't help but hope that one day we all decide "good enough" isn't good enough anymore. That we demand devices that are different, interesting, special. Samsung's proved that it can do anything it sets its mind to � I can't wait to see what happens if it decides to really, truly care.Photography by Michael ShaneThe BreakdownMore times than not, the Verge score is based on the average of the subscores below.

Then it all goes downhill from thereRapidly deteriorating battery life has long been tolerated by smartphone owners, mainly because they have no choice. Phones usually meet the holy grail of battery life, the ability to last all day, at first. Then it starts getting worse quickly, until many phone owners end up plugging in during the day. It seems it's always been this way, and there's no incentive to the smartphone makers to make this better.Battery has long been the focus of the mobile segment. In the early days of mobile the possible time away from a power outlet was not very long. This prompted OEMs to do what they could to make batteries in mobile devices last longer.This is why we now have decent battery life with most laptops and tablets. The eight hours needed to go all day no matter what comes up is now met by many mobile devices. Except the smartphone.Pick any smartphone in the top ranks and talk to those who've owned one for a while. Odds are, you'll hear a familiar tale � the phone easily lasted all day when new but that didn't last. If they've owned the phone over a year you'll probably hear about the antics they go through daily to have a phone that is still working at day's end.See related:  Falling tablet sales: The problem is they're just too good |  Necessary battery life for laptops: 8 hoursSo why hasn't smartphone battery life improved like that on tablets and laptops? I believe the reason is obvious � there is no incentive for OEMs to improve this. In fact, there's an incentive to keep things the way they've always been.In a recent article I explained that tablet owners aren't upgrading because current devices are good enough . There's no compelling reason for tablet owners to get the latest and greatest because the one they have is good enough.Good battery life is a big part of that satisfaction with tablets. Most of the top tablets get 10+ hours of battery life, and that's enough for just about everyone. Even over time when those tablet batteries start deteriorating, resulting in shorter battery life, they still last all day given the long life they start with when new.With smartphones it's a different story. Many are on the edge of all-day battery life to start, and they fall short as the battery ages. This is common. Take a stroll around the web and you'll find hundreds of articles with tips for "how to extend the battery on gadget X". Owners are trying to get through the day with a smartphone that's only a year old, and they'll do anything to make that happen.That includes trading in that phone when their US contract is up. I believe it's not just a hankering for the latest shiny smartphone available, it's also to get rid of their old one. They know from experience that their battery life issue will go away with a new phone, due to that new battery inside.This is why there is no incentive for smartphone makers to come up with a new battery technology with the same improvements we've seen in laptops and tablets. They need that two-year replacement cycle the phone contracts push, and the dying battery syndrome fuels that upgrade process.I'm not suggesting there's some hidden conspiracy behind the smartphone battery situation. I am pointing out that from a business perspective there is no incentive for smartphone makers to improve battery life as they have on other mobile devices. They are happy when you trade that phone in for a new one. They just hope you don't figure out what they are doing. If something's not broken, why fix it?What Makes a Smartphone a Superphone?At the MobileBeat conference today, Samsung's CSO Omar Khan talked about what he calls "the year of the superphone."Since the iPhone made its debut in 2007, we've seen incredible strides in mobile hardware and software. It's getting to the point that we hesitate to call these micro-computers "phones." Their capabilities now go far beyond what we'd expect from simple telephony, and are beginning to touch the horizon of "the future" � that mystical era in which technology will solve all our problems.Of course, Khan was eager to talk about the Galaxy S, a new Android device Samsung is bringing to market, but he also got into some of the general qualifications that distinguish the superphone from the smartphone.A smartphone, of course, has hardware features such as a touchscreen and some kind of QWERTY keyboard. It has native applications and web browsing; most have and make innovative use of cameras, both still and video.What, then, makes a smartphone a superphone?Google coined the "superphone" nomenclature at the launch of the Nexus One. Khan said these devices are "optimized from a silicon perspective, a hardware perspective and a software perspective.�In general terms, a superphone has more deep access to hardware capabilities, and the hardware is a step above what you'd see in a smartphone. Screens are larger � in excess of four inches, in some cases. The superphone has an impressive camera, generally between five and eight megapixels, that lends itself to high-quality photo and video capturing. It has multiple microphones for noise cancellation, both for calls and video recording.And Khan also said 2010 is "the year of the gigahertz processor." Newer best-in-class mobiles that feature 1Ghz processors include the Galaxy, the Evo, the Incredible, the Droid X and the iPhone 4.In addition to better hardware, superphones have better software. The operating system iterations � including Android Froyo and iOS from Apple � are adding "superfeatures" such as true multitasking and are allowing for what Khan called �signature experiences �- a fine marriage of hardware and software."This union of hardware and software means that the better displays will allow for high-quality video and gaming experiences � not just social and casual gaming, but games that appeal to the hardcore gamer as well. And accelerometers, cameras and GPS systems built into superphones allow for amazing location-based service and augmented reality applications.In general, social applications on superphones are more integrated, and web browsing with open-source Webkit browsers is more advanced and much faster."It's the power of a netbook in the palm of your hand," Khan concluded. "What users expect is the same experience they have on their netbooks or PCs in an uncompromised fashion."Of course, mobile apps have been a driving and enriching force in the evolution of the superphone. The Apple/Android arms race has led to a staggering 220,000 apps in the App Store and 70,000 in the Android Market. Year over year, we're using our mobiles more and more to access news, social networks and even video content. In fact, the most popular apps are accessed every day by around 60% of their users.So, what comes after the superphone? We can joke about the "superduperphone" or the "�berphone," but the acceleration of technology is mind-boggling to say the least. Will human innovation be able to keep pace with machine capabilities? Will we see more applications that are truly useful to individuals and society, or will the space continue to see waves of novelty or "trash" apps?Samsung Waves away a millionKOREAN ELECTRONICS CONGLOMERATE Samsung has managed to shift one million of its Wave smartphones.The Wave managed to reach the sales milestone in just four weeks, a feat that is made more important by the fact that the device is the first to run Samsung's Bada operating system. Putting Samsung's sales figures into perspective, Apple's first Iphone took over 80 days to reach the million mark.Bada is Samsung's attempt to move its devices away from proprietary operating systems that offer little in terms of expandability. Depending on the device's specifications, Bada could be deployed with either a Linux or some other real-time operating system.The firm is hoping that Bada becomes a credible alternative to other smartphone operating systems, and to that end Bada has an application store. The firm is currently running a competition to boost application development, though it expects to have 7,000 applications by the end of the year. In contrast, Apple's App Store already has over 200,000 applications and the Android Market is nearing 100,000.While Samsung might be pushing Bada, it has hedged its bets by producing a number of devices that run Google's Android operating system, and again, sales figures show that was a pretty good idea.The company has managed to flog the much vaunted Galaxy S to 300,000 punters in just 19 days. Those figures are all the more impressive when you realise that represents just South Korean sales and that the Galaxy S is targeted at the high-end market. Although overall figures are not quite up there with Motorola's Milestone, the rate is impressive and bodes well for both Samsung and Android developers.Such healthy sales figures should result in Samsung continuing its two-pronged approach to pursuing greater market share in smartphones.Worldwide smartphone user base hits 1 billionA year ago, the total installed base for smartphones had reached 708 million, according to Strategy Analytics.The smartphone industry has reached an important milestone.During the third quarter, the total installed base for smartphones worldwide hit 1.04 billion, jumping from the 959 million smartphones in use during the second quarter, research firm Strategy Analytics announced today. Just a year ago, the total worldwide smartphone installed base was 708 million.It took 16 years for smartphones to reach the 1 billion mark. The Nokia Communicator, a device that first launched in 1996, is widely viewed as the first smartphone to hit store shelves. Since then, a host of smartphone makers have jumped into the fray."Nokia remained a dominant force in smartphones for over a decade until the arrival of Apple's iconic iPhone in 2007," Strategy Analytics senior analyst Scott Bicheno said today in a statement. "The iPhone revolutionized smartphone design and it catalyzed industry growth."Neil Mawston, Strategy Analytics' executive director, estimates that one in seven people around the world owned a smartphone during the third quarter. However, he noted that penetration is still "relatively low," creating a huge market opportunity for vendors."Most of the world does not yet own a smartphone and there remains huge scope for future growth, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India and Africa," Mawston said today in a statement. "The first billion smartphones in use worldwide took 16 years to reach, but we forecast the next billion to be achieved in less than three years, by 2015."Research firm Ovum earlier this year also said that it believes smartphone ownership will soar in the coming years. That company reported that smartphone shipments hit 448 million units last year and will jump to 1.7 billion by 2017.Xiaomi breaks into global top 10 for smartphone shipments, kicks out HTC279.4 million smartphones shipped globally in Q1 2014 � and 97.5 million of those are in China. The most significant change in the newest figures from Canalys is that Chinese phone-maker Xiaomi has broken into the global top 10 for the first time.Boosted by buyers in China, half of the worldwide top 10 phone brands are now Chinese. Huawei is third, Lenovo fourth, Xiaomi debuts in sixth, Coolpad is eighth, and ZTE is ninth. Samsung remains the global smartphone leader, accounting for 31 percent of shipments, while Apple is second with 16 percent.According to analyst Tomi Ahonen this morning on Twitter, Xiaomi�s entrance effectively kicks HTC out of the global top ten:Samsung still rocking ChinaDespite all the homegrown competition, Samsung is still ahead of the pack in China, where it leads with 18 percent market share. Xiaomi got a huge boost in its home market in the newest numbers, now moving up to third place. Canalys doesn�t give the full list of 10 for either China or the global line-up.See: 15 new Asian smartphone makers hoping to crush Samsung and AppleXiaomi ships 97 percent of its phones in mainland China, according to Canalys. So it�s not truly a global player in the same way as Chinese brands like Huawei, which ships 45 percent of its smartphones outside of China.Xiaomi sells its Android-based phones in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. The upstart brand is working on launches in 10 new countries this year, including major markets like India and Indonesia. Xiaomi�s Hugo Barra explained to Tech in Asia last week that its next launch will happen in Malaysia in the next few weeks.Stephen Hawking warns artificial intelligence could end mankindProf Stephen Hawking, one of Britain's pre-eminent scientists, has said that efforts to create thinking machines pose a threat to our very existence.He told the BBC:"The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race."His warning came in response to a question about a revamp of the technology he uses to communicate, which involves a basic form of AI.But others are less gloomy about AI's prospects.The theoretical physicist, who has the motor neurone disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is using a new system developed by Intel to speak.Machine learning experts from the British company Swiftkey were also involved in its creation. Their technology, already employed as a smartphone keyboard app, learns how the professor thinks and suggests the words he might want to use next.Prof Hawking says the primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far have already proved very useful, but he fears the consequences of creating something that can match or surpass humans.It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate," he said.Cleverbot is software that is designed to chat like a human would"Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded."But others are less pessimistic."I believe we will remain in charge of the technology for a decently long time and the potential of it to solve many of the world problems will be realised," said Rollo Carpenter, creator of Cleverbot.Cleverbot's software learns from its past conversations, and has gained high scores in the Turing test, fooling a high proportion of people into believing they are talking to a human.Rise of the robotsMr Carpenter says we are a long way from having the computing power or developing the algorithms needed to achieve full artificial intelligence, but believes it will come in the next few decades."We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence, so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it," he says.But he is betting that AI is going to be a positive force.Prof Hawking is not alone in fearing for the future.In the short term, there are concerns that clever machines capable of undertaking tasks done by humans until now will swiftly destroy millions of jobs.Elon Musk, chief executive of rocket-maker Space X, also fears artificial intellign the longer term, the technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has warned that AI is "our biggest existential threat".Robotic voiceIn his BBC interview, Prof Hawking also talks of the benefits and dangers of the internet.He quotes the director of GCHQ's warning about the net becoming the command centre for terrorists: "More must be done by the internet companies to counter the threat, but the difficulty is to do this without sacrificing freedom and privacy."He has, however, been an enthusiastic early adopter of all kinds of communication technologies and is looking forward to being able to write much faster with his new systemBut one aspect of his own tech - his computer generated voice - has not changed in the latest update.Prof Hawking concedes that it's slightly robotic, but insists he didn't want a more natural voice."It has become my trademark, and I wouldn't change it for a more natural voice with a British accent," he said."I'm told that children who need a computer voice, want one like mine."Kan names quake at pep talkPrime Minister Naoto Kan said Friday that preparations for restoration and reconstruction work have begun in disaster-hit areas and Japan will prevail over the hardships caused by the massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11.He did not, however, offer an outlook on when the damaged Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant will be stabilized.Kan Friday night marked three weeks since the deadly tsunami ripped up the northeast coast by naming the temblor that spawned it the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (Higashi Nihon Dai-Shinsai)."I am confident that we will overcome the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake . . . and re-create a wonderful Japan," he said."And I promise that I myself and my Cabinet will stand at the forefront and devote all of our energy" to rebuilding it.To prepare for the restoration, Kan said he will freeze part of the fiscal 2011 budget, which cleared the Diet Tuesday, and transfer the money to a supplementary budget."I want to prepare the first extra budget and use it to get rid of debris, build temporary housing, secure jobs and restore industry," Kan said, adding the government will submit the first legislation for the plan this month.He also said a special panel of experts and local leaders will be set up by April 11 to "draft a blueprint" for rebuilding damaged areas.As for Fukushima No. 1, Kan said that once the situation is stabilized, he intends to look at various aspects of the crisis, including how to balance national electricity supplies in the future. Kan did not, however, clarify his position on whether Japan should reduce its heavy reliance on nuclear power."Of course solar, wind and biomass energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide are very important," Kan said. "But in a sense, I think that nuclear power should also get credit from the viewpoint of not emitting carbon dioxide and that naturally, we need to continue thinking about how to balance supply."Campbell impressedWASHINGTON (Kyodo) Kurt Campbell, the senior U.S. State Department official in charge of East Asia, voiced high praise Thursday for the way Japan is coping with the March 11 devastation.Tsunami, earthquake, nuclear crisis � now Japan faces power cutsPrime minister warns of biggest crisis since 1945 withrolling cuts aimed at averting total blackoutJapan is facing its greatest crisis since the second world war, its prime minister, Naoto Kan, warned as the country struggled for a third day to avert a nuclear disaster following the massive earthquake and tsunami.Police warn that the death toll could exceed 10,000 in Miyagi prefecture alone, and a UN agency reported that more than 1,600 people were confirmed dead. Most are thought to have drowned."The earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear incident have been the biggest crisis Japan has encountered in the 65 years since the end of the second world war," Kan told news media. "We're under scrutiny on whether we, the Japanese people, can overcome this crisis."The extent of this challenge was underscored by the news that the capital of the world's third largest economy will see rolling three-hour power cuts from Monday.Officials have ordered the measure because nuclear plant closures have drastically reduced the electricity supply. They warn that the blackouts could last for weeks."We have to avoid at all costs a sudden power shortage whose scale could have devastating consequences for the economy and people's lives," Kan said.Friday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, upgraded from 8.9, is the worst in Japan's recorded history and the fifth strongest worldwide in the past century. It caused a tsunami 10 metres high in some places.As aftershocks continued to shake the coast, the Foreign Office urged Britons to avoid all non-essential travel to Tokyo and the north-east of Japan, while the US state department recommended that Americans stay away from Japan.The Japanese meteorological agency warned that there was a 70% possibility of a magnitude 7 or greater tremor during the next three days. It lifted the tsunami warning, but cautioned that aftershocks could cause further waves.The agency also warned that a volcano in the south was erupting again after a fortnight without noticeable activity. Ash and rock spewed from the crater of Shinmoedake on Kyushu island, 950 miles from the epicentre of Friday's tremor. There were no reports of injuries or damage.Tokyo has doubled the number of troops in its rescue and relief team, but damage to roads and bridges has hampered efforts."Rescue and relief operations are being hampered by continuous aftershocks, tsunami alerts and fires. Many areas along the north-east coast remain isolated and unreachable," the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement.It reported that at least 1,600 people were known to have died and 10,000 were missing. Almost 600,000 have been displaced, or evacuated, because of the earthquake and tsunami or radiation fears, it added.Etsuko Oyama, who was rescued by a neighbour after the wave swept her 400 metres from her home, struggled to hold back tears as she spoke to NHK's news channel, the Japanese public broadcaster."I grabbed my daughter's hand but I lost my grip when I was swept away by the debris and water," she said. "I managed to survive but my daughter was washed away � I hope she is still alive somewhere."Japanese troops rescued a 60-year-old man who was swept 10 miles out to sea on the roof of his home. But Hiromitsu Shinkawa said his wife had been washed away when the tsunami hit as they returned home to gather possessions after the quake.While there were welcome moments of celebration as survivors were reunited, any good news was generally alloyed by grief.With phone services still down in many areas, many survivors made their way to civic centres to check boards with names of others known to have survived and those who had died.The Kyodo news agency reported that more than 20,000 buildings nationwide were either destroyed or badly damaged. Some 2.6 million households were without power and 1.4 million without drinking water, said Japan's ministry of health, labour and welfare, although electricity was restored to some parts of Sendai city. Others in the area reported food shortages.Survivors huddled in public shelters for another night in near-freezing temperatures. In addition to the central government's relief efforts, cities and private businesses have sent help. The deputy mayor of Tokyo said the city was dispatching 384,000 blankets and 9,000 portable toilets, while Nissin, an instant noodle manufacturer, said it would send a million packets and "kitchen cars" equipped with stoves and water.International relief and rescue teams from more than a dozen countries, including China, the US and the UK, are arriving to help Japanese troops. Almost 70 countries have offered donations, such as India's consignment of blankets and self-contained field hospitals from Australia.Many of the donors, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have been scarred by earthquakes or tsunamis in recent years.Kandahar in southern Afghanistan also pledged cash. "I know $50,000 [�31,000] is not a lot of money for a country like Japan, but it is a show of appreciation from the Kandahar people," Ghulam Haidar Hamidi, the mayor, told Reuters.Yukio Edano, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, has said the government would use its contingency funds of some 200bn yen (�1.5bn) to pay for the relief effort. But there is already talk of a possible temporary tax increase to fund relief work.Japan, overtaken by China last year as the world's second largest economy, will require tens of billions of dollars for reconstruction. The 1995 Kobe earthquake is said to have been the most expensive natural disaster in history, causing more than �1bn damage.The country will also need to count the cost of industrial losses, with much of the north-east at a standstill.Japan's megaquake: what we know0930 GMT, 12 March 2011Sumit Paul-Choudhury, editor, newscientist.comThere has been a massive explosion at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant, raising fears of a radioactive meltdown. Several workers are believed to have been injured in the blast, which seems to have caused major structural damage to the plant.A state of nuclear emergency was declared at the plant yesterday as its operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, struggled to contain rising temperatures and pressures in the core of two reactors whose cooling systems failed after Friday's magnitude 9.0 earthquake. An emergency has now also been declared at the neighbouring Fukushima Daini plant.Read more: Our live blog on the reactor explosion1830 GMT, 11 March 2011The US Air Force is delivering a cargo of liquid coolant to the Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant - where one of six reactors seriously affected by today's quake is still alarmingly hot many hours after it was automatically shut down when the quake struck.Electrical, mechanical and diesel generator failures are said to have combined to deprive the reactor of power for its coolant pumps.The Tokyo Electric Power Co told Japanese news service Jiji News that pressure in the reactor vessel is rising and that the company intends to "take measures" to release it. CNN reports that activity around the plant hints at a "struggle" to cool down the facility. Indeed, Japan's trade minister said this evening that there could well be what he described as "small radiation leak" from the Fukushima plant.US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton said local US air bases are helping deliver the coolant. The reactor - one of six - is thought to be a boiling water reactor, so the coolant is likely to be demineralised light water, meaning it is depleted of the hydrogen isotope deuterium.Some 3000 people living within a 3-kilometre radius of the Fukushima plant have been evacuated by the Japanese defence force.1722 GMT, 11 March 2011Seismologists at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, have just revised their calculations regarding the magnitude of today's quake. They now say it was magnitude 9.0. Already one of the top 10 recorded earthquakes in history, the revision suggests the quake was even more powerful than first thought.Harold Tobin of the University of Wisconsin-Madison told New Scientist that this figure will probably change again. This is typical in the hours after a large seismic event, as more information becomes available.Earlier today, it was suggested that the tremor may have occurred along a splay fault - a branch off the main megathrust fault which runs through this area of the Japan trench. If so, that could mean the fault was previously unknown to geologists.Splay faults tend to break at steeper angles than megathrust quakes, making them highly likely to lead to a large uplift of the seafloor that produces damaging tsunamis such as the one that crashed ashore in Sendai and the Honshu coast earlier today.But the new set of calculations indicate that the giant quake ruptured at an angle of 14 degrees below horizontal. Such a shallow slip suggests the earthquake did in fact occur along the main megathrust fault.Tobin said that in the next few days, seismologists will be working feverishly to come up with a new set of calculations known as an "inversion" to determine over what area the fault slipped and how great the slip was. It's likely to have been several metres for an earthquake of this magnitude.Once that's established, geologists will begin to look at how this earthquake may have transferred stress onto - or away from - faults in the Tokyo bay and Nankai trough regions, to the south-west.This will help get a handle on the big question that will be on everyone's mind: when, and where, will it happen again?The Japanese government declared its first ever "state of nuclear emergency" today after two of its nuclear power stations suffered major failures in the aftermath of today's earthquake.Quake damage cost one plant its reactor cooling system - an absolutely critical capability for a nuclear facility - while another suffered a fire in its turbine hall. Residents in a 3-kilometre radius of the coolant-afflicted plant have been evacuated.Both incidents were considered risky enough to require the issuing of emergency alerts to the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna, Austria. However, the Japanese government insists this was precautionary and that no radiation release has occurred.As the quake struck, seismic sensors triggered shutdowns at 15 of Japan's nuclear power stations. Eleven are thought to have resumed operation, but the four nearest the epicentre have remained shut - and the problems occurred at two of those.After a nuclear plant is shut down, control rods are normally inserted into the reactor core to quench the fission reaction. But the reactor remains hot and still needs cooling.At the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, located just to the south of the Miyagi district, which was worst hit by the quake and tsunami, electrical systems powering the plant's cooling system failed - and a backup diesel generator powering water pumps didn't cut in. The shut-down reactor remains hot."Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency says the plant has been shut down and no release of radiation has been detected," said the IAEA in a statement.Nearer the epicentre, the Onagawa nuclear plant in Miyagi was pictured with smoke streaming from its turbine building. While that's not a nuclear issue as such - it uses superheated steam to turn a generator - any incident near a reactor is bad news. The fire is now said to be out.These failures will probably speed efforts to make Japan's nuclear plants more rugged against seismic risks - a process that was set in train after a July 2007 quake severely damaged Japan's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata prefecture.1305 GMT, 11 March 2011The Japanese earthquake has triggered a series of tsunami waves that are now moving east across the Pacific. How will the countries they hit be affected?The shape of each landmass is a major factor determining how the tsunami behaves. Tsunamis are most dangerous when they run over a large area of shallow water. This causes the first wavefront to slow down, so successive waves pile up to form one tremendous wave.As a result small Pacific islands, especially ones that lie in otherwise deep water, should be largely unaffected. Wave height here might reach 30 centimetres at most. "A little atoll presents a pencil in the water, and the wave just goes right past," says Robert Cessaro, a senior geophysicist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii. Because most of the islands in the tsunami's path are fairly small, they should see waves 10 to 30 centimetres high at most.Islands with a diameter of 80 kilometres, including any underwater sediment surrounding them, will slow down the waves and thus experience a larger tsunami impact."It looks like the Hawaiian islands will see [waves] between 1 and 2 metres [in height], depending on where you are," Cessaro says. The first wave is expected in Hawaii at 1707 GMT (0307 local time).Most of the tsunami's force seems to be heading for the west coast of North America, which could see waves of up to 40 centimetres in some areas. California will see the highest waves, with Alaska "pretty much out of the beam", says Cessaro.California's Crescent City, which is susceptible to tsunamis because of its confined bay, could get up to 1 metre. Residents have been urged to move to higher ground.South America is expected to see less of an effect than North America. Waves with a height of roughly 20 to 30 centimetres may occur here.Cessaro emphasises that these figures are rough. Data on the tsunami is still coming in, and the PTWC will be updating their models throughout the day. As the wave moves on, more gauges will be affected, the measurements generated will feed into the models and the picture will become clearer.1230 GMT, 11 March 2011The US National Oceanographical and Atmospheric Agency has produced this map showing when the tsunamis are expected to hit land across the Pacific. The quake was at 0546 GMT, meaning Hawaii could see the first waves around 1700 GMT (0300 local time) and smaller, low-lying Pacific islands like Tuvalu could be hit in the coming few hours.The University of Southern California's Tsunami Research Centre also has this map showing the theoretical path of a tsunami, with maximum wave heights. The map is not a forecast for today's events, but the results of modelling studies the centre has done in the past for a quake of similar location and magnitude.1200 GMT, 11 March 2011Andy Coghlan, reporterBrian Baptie, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, UK, answers our questions on the Japan quake and related tsunamis, reported at 10 metres in Sendai port in Miyagi prefecture, north-eastern Japan.Are the recent huge quakes linked?This one is on the same scale as the Chile quake last year and the Sumatran quake in 2004, so there is a sequence that's been followed. They're all caused by motion of tectonic plates. There's no causal link between them, but it is possible that one quake could trigger another, so it's possible Sumatra has unleashed a chain of quakes and rupture segments to the west of Sumatra.But it's not linked to the recent earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. This latest quake was 8000 times large than the Christchurch quake in terms of the energy released, so it's a different beast.What was the geology of the quake?Japan sites at the boundary between two tectonic plates - there are eight major plates worldwide. To the east of Japan is the Pacific plate, and Japan itself sits on the Eurasian plate. The Pacific plate is moving west at about 8 centimetres a year, and is pushing down beneath Japan itself. As the plates push past each other, a massive amount of strain energy is generated, which builds up in the rocks. Sometimes the strain can build for many years, and that's the underlying cause for earthquakes in Japan. The amplitude of the quake decreases rapidly from the epicentre, although it will be felt across all Japan.What about the tsunamis now moving east?They travel at the speed of a jet airliner and propagate at low amplitude deep in the ocean. As they approach land, the tsunami slows down but the amplitude increases, generating waves with huge energy. So you still get large waves several metres high many hours after the original quake. They can still cause extreme amounts of damage many kilometres away. Also, individual tsunamis can last for many waves, and sometimes the first is not the biggest.Was Japan ready?Japan is a country with a long history of earthquakes, but this one is unprecedented in Japanese history. The previous largest was Great Kanto in 1923, south of Tokyo, which resulted in 140,000 deaths, and that was 7.9 magnitude. That puts this latest one in perspective. It's easily the largest Japan has ever experienced.Japan has well-regulated building codes, and large buildings are constructed not to collapse. Also, people are well prepared both for quakes and tsunamis, with regular evacuation drills. All those will have saved life this time.Are Japan's nuclear facilities safe?They're unlikely to collapse in a quake, but they will have experienced strong shaking. Reactors have their own earthquake warning system that shut them down automatically. These also work for high-speed rail networks. But it's difficult to say what damage there's been to these facilities.1032 GMT, 11 March 2011A massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the north-east coast of Japan today, creating a tsunami that hit the north of the country and sparking tsunami alerts around the Pacific.According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the quake hit at 0546 GMT, with its epicentre 373 kilometres north-east of Tokyo. Preliminary reports suggest it occurred at a depth of 24.4 kilometres.Japan's Meteorological Agency says that movements in the crust caused by the quake created a tsunami that moved towards Japan's east coast, reportedly reaching a height of 10 metres at the point of impact.Kevin McCue, a seismologist at Central Queensland University, Australia, says tsunami waves "will be impacting other countries in the north Pacific in the coming hours".Already, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has issued a tsunami warning for many areas bordering the Pacific. The first wave is expected in Hawaii at 1707 GMT (0307 local time).James Goff, a tsunami researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that tsunamis are virtually inevitable given the power of the earthquake. "Japan has a rigorous earthquake building code and excellent tsunami warning system and evacuation plans - this event will likely provide a severe test for all of them," he says.While details of the devastation in Japan remain murky, there have already been numerous reports of injuries, and five confirmed deaths. Power has been cut to 4 million homes in and around Tokyo. Five nuclear power plants in northern Japan have been shut down, but there are no reports of leaked chemicals.Earthquakes are common in Japan because it is one of the most seismically active regions in the world. On 26 February the country experienced a 5.2-magnitude quake; a 7.2-magnitude quake hit just two days ago, and was followed by four more quakes yesterday. But quakes of a similar magnitude to today's are rare. It is similar in scale to the quake that hit Chile almost a year ago to the day."This is the largest earthquake known in Japan," says McCue. There have been just seven earthquakes in Japan over magnitude eight since 1891.New USGS number puts Japan quake at 4th largestU.S. Geological Survey upgrades deadly Japan earthquake to 9.0 after Japan's Meteorological Agency did sameLOS ANGELES - The U.S. Geological Survey has upgraded the magnitude of Friday's deadly earthquake in Japan to 9.0The move Monday comes after Japan's Meteorological Agency did the same. It's not unusual for scientists to tweak the magnitude of a giant quake after some number-crunching.Complete coverage: Disaster in JapanU.S. government scientists originally put the Japan quake at 8.9. The change to 9.0 means that the quake was about 1.5 times stronger than initially thought.The Japan quake is now the fourth largest in the world since 1900 behind the 2004 magnitude-9.1 Sumatra quakeJapan earthquake: Tsunami hits north-eastJapan's most powerful earthquake since records began has struck the north-east coast, triggering a massive tsunami.Cars, ships and buildings were swept away by a wall of water after the 8.9-magnitude tremor, which struck about 400km (250 miles) north-east of Tokyo.A state of emergency has been declared at a nuclear power plant, where pressure has exceeded normal levels.Officials say 350 people are dead and about 500 missing, but it is feared the final death toll will be much higher.In one ward alone in Sendai, a port city in Miyagi prefecture, 200 to 300 bodies were found.The quake was the fifth-largest in the world since 1900 and nearly 8,000 times stronger than the one which devastated Christchurch, New Zealand, last month, said scientists.Thousands of people living near the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been ordered to evacuate.Japanese nuclear officials said pressure inside a boiling water reactor at the plant was running much higher than normal after the cooling system failed.Officials said they might need to deliberately release some radioactive steam to relieve pressure, but that there would be no health risk.US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had earlier said the US Air Force had flown emergency coolant to the site.But US officials later said no coolant had been handed over because the Japanese had decided to handle the situation themselves.The UN's nuclear agency said four nuclear power plants had shut down safely.Measured at 8.9 by the US Geological Survey, it struck at 1446 local time (0546 GMT) at a depth of about 24km.The tsunami rolled across the Pacific at 800km/h (500mph) - as fast as a jetliner - before hitting Hawaii and the US West Coast, but there were no reports of major damage from those regions.Japan quake: video reportsQuake: Wave forecast mapThousands of people were ordered to evacuate coastal areas in the states of California, Oregon and Washington.The biggest waves of more than 6-7ft (about 2m) were recorded near California's Crescent City, said the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre.A tsunami warning extended across the Pacific to North and South America, where many other coastal regions were evacuated, but the alert was later lifted in most parts, including the Philippines, Australia and China.Strong waves hit Japan's Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures, damaging dozens of coastal communities.A 10m wave struck Sendai, deluging farmland and sweeping cars across the airport's runway. Fires broke out in the centre of the city.Japan's NHK television showed a massive surge of debris-filled water reaching far inland, consuming houses, cars and ships.Motorists could be seen trying to speed away from the wall of water.This is the kind of earthquake that hits once every 100 yearsAkira Tanaka, Restaurant workerIn pictures: Japan quakeProduction halted at plantsGoogle aids quake victimsIn other developments:Four trains are missing along the coast, says Japan Railways; and a ship carrying 100 people was swept awayFire has engulfed swathes of the coast in Miyagi prefecture's Kesennuma city, one-third of which is reportedly under waterA major explosion hit a petrochemical plant in Sendai; further south a huge blaze swept an oil refinery in Ichihara city, Chiba prefectureSome 1,800 homes are reported to have been destroyed in the city of Minamisoma, Fukushima prefectureA dam burst in north-eastern Fukushima prefecture, sweeping away homes, Kyodo news agency reportsAt least 20 people were injured in Tokyo when the roof of a hall collapsed on to a graduation ceremonyIn a televised address, Prime Minister Naoto Kan extended his sympathy to the victims of the disaster.As aftershocks rattled the country, residents and workers in Tokyo rushed outside to gather in parks and open spaces.Many people in the Japanese capital said they had never felt such a powerful earthquake.In central Tokyo, a number of office workers are spending the night in their offices because the lifts have stopped working."This is the kind of earthquake that hits once every 100 years," said restaurant worker Akira Tanaka.Train services were suspended, stranding millions of commuters in the Japanese capital.About four million homes in and around Tokyo suffered power cuts.Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom� Trailer Features New U2 Song �Ordinary Love�A just-released trailer for the movie �Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom� has a new soundtrack that features the music of U2.The coming Weinstein Company biopic, which stars Idris Elba as South African leader Nelson Mandela and Naomie Harris as his wife Winnie, just premiered a new clip that features �Ordinary Love,� a song written especially for the film by U2.In the trailer, we hear U2 frontman Bono singing a steadily building rocker as we see images from �Mandela.� �All the beauty that�s been lost before wants to find us again,� he sings.Mandela has inspired many other songs. The Special A.K.A., for example, scored a hit with �Free Nelson Mandela� in the 1980s. And U2 has experience writing about human rights heroes�the band�s song �Pride (In the Name of Love)� was featured on its 1984 album �The Unforgettable Fire.� That song dealt with Martin Luther King, Jr.Watch the new trailer for �Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom� here. What do you think of the new U2 song?Maharishi�s Minions Come to Wall StreetWhen the Beatles sought guidance from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1968, they traveled to India. Now that the �giggling guru,� as he has been called, is seeking investors, a branch of his organization has come to the New York financial district.In March, Maharishi�s Global Financial Capital of New York quietly opened a headquarters at 70 Broad Street, close to the New York Stock Exchange. The organization had purchased the five-story, 20,000-square-foot building in May 2004 from Goldman Properties for $5.5 million.The group was drawn to the building, the former home of the American Bank Note Company and its first Manhattan property, for reasons both spiritual and practical.�It�s one of the very few buildings in all of New York City that�s oriented due east,� said Paul Potter, the director of Global Financial Capital, referring to the Maharishi�s principles of �Vedic architecture� that hold that east-facing buildings are spiritually healthy.But, Mr. Potter added, the other incentive was the financial district location and access to the world�s moneymakers.�We�ve been offering our programs for 50 years,� he said, �and now is the time that we want to create financial support for these programs. We want to offer a chance for the investment bankers to steer the finances of the world in this positive direction.�The building required extensive renovations, which continue, and will cost about $4.9 million, according to the organization, which took out a mortgage in 2005 to cover them. In addition to donations and income from real estate assets, the Maharishi�s worldwide network is financed primarily by classes in transcendental meditation, which cost $2,500 for a one-time, five-day session.The new building�s first floor is open for business, with meeting rooms to welcome the investment bankers and hold videoconferences. The Maharishi, who is at least 90, conducts many of these Webcasts from a Dutch village, Vlodrop, where he has established his Global Country of World Peace.The building purchase was a canny one considering the financial district�s resurgence, the broker, David N. Lebenstein, director of the nonprofit division at Colliers ABR, said. �Building prices are at least 30 to 50 percent more than in 2004 and in some cases 100 percent more,� he said, adding that the Maharishi�s choice to buy an entire building is unusual for nonprofits downtown. Most prefer to avoid overhead costs by purchasing commercial condos or leasing long-term office space, he said.Those overhead costs may yet prove to be a challenge for the Maharishi, who has had decidedly mixed success in the real estate business. While he established the Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, he has stumbled in developing properties including a Chicago hotel that was eventually sold and a proposed S�o Paulo skyscraper that was abandoned after Brazil stalled on approval.Plans for 3,000 worldwide �peace palaces,� which will teach transcendental meditation and the elusive art of �yogic flying,� have also had mixed reactions. (Four of the projected 200 palaces in the United States have been completed, while land for 52 others has been acquired.)In January, The Plain Dealer in Cleveland published an article reviewing the Maharishi�s history in developing two local properties that were later sold and questioning whether his palace proposals would ever come to fruition. And in March, the Maharishi�s organization sued the city of Mayfield Heights, Ohio, saying it refused to allow a proposed peace palace setback variances given to local corporate offices.When asked about these earthly roadblocks, Mr. Potter seemed, well, serene. �The pursuit of money hasn�t really brought real happiness, real fulfillment,� he said. �We hope to be able to rebuild the whole world to be fortune-oriented buildings, to be heaven on earth.�
